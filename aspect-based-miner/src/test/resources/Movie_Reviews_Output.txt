Why do I want to write the th comment on The Shawshank Redemption
I am not sure almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said
But like so many other people who wrote comments I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption
The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird
Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them
I did nt intend to see this movie at all I do not like prison movies and I do nt normally watch them
I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better
At the time I thought that was very strange
One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already
I remembered what she said so I watched it
I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing
No action no special effects just men in prison uniforms talking to each otherThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen
I do not judge it by it s technical merits I do nt really care about that
I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made
They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best
The best movies are ones that touch the soul
It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul
Can Hollywood usually creating things for entertainment purposes only create art
To create something of this nature a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner due to the delicacy of the process
Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films the most prominent music visuals script and acting
These elements each equally important must succeed independently yet still form a harmonious union because this mixture determines the fate of the artist s opus
Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut The Shawshank Redemption
Proving himself already a master of the craft Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood
The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre defies the odds compels the emotions and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood
The story begins with the trial of a young banker Andy Dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover
After a quick conviction Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison with no hope of parole
He exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him
His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from Ellis Redding
Ellis commonly referred to as Red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison
Andy s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him
Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle
By creating the film s firm foundation the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film s success
Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King s equally noteworthy novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
In this novella King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature
Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever
While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella Darabont also proves that a film s score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience as dialogue does
He employs the cunning Thomas Newman son of the legendary Hollywood composer Alfred Newman
Darabont shows recognition for the film s needs by employing Newman who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer as if a part of the scripted dialogue
Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition
His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed as his score received an Oscar nomination in
While unique and independent Newman s score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film
With work from vast array of talented scene designers costume designers composers cinematographers and various other Hollywood artists the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with
The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film
While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red respectively the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles
Most noticeable of these the veteran film star James Whitmore who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen
Brooks a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead
Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art and a focused purpose in their motivations creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable
With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts like hope and freedom
These themes which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story
Though full of hardened criminals your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date
Like a great novel this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience
Darabont tells his story most masterfully illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think
He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption something we all seek
This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich s and predictability
Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities
These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you
The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film
It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption
Shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams
And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope
Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you do nt feel that far removed from what the characters are going through
It is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message
Frank Darabont did nt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him
Why this movie did nt win all seven Oscars is beyond me but do nt let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the IMDb s top list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you
Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie
You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie
In its Oscar year Shawshank Redemption LRB written and directed by Frank Darabont after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King RRB was nominated for seven Academy Awards and walked away with zero
Best Picture went to Forrest Gump while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were just happy to be nominated
Of course hindsight is but while history looks back on Gump as a good film Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the alltime best
Pulp however was a success from the word go making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writerdirector an American master after only two films
For Andy Dufresne and Co success did nt come easy
Fortunately failure was nt a life sentence
After opening on screens with take of the M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere M
The reasons for failure are many
Firstly the title is a clunker
While iconic to fans today in people knew not and cared not what a Shawshank was
On the DVD Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that Rickshaw movie
Marketingwise the film s a nightmare as prison drama is a tough sell to women and the story of love between two best friends does nt spell winner to men
Worst of all the movie is slow as molasses
As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale
But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong
Firstly its setting
The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eyeopener
This is an amazing piece of architecture strong and Gothic in design
Immediately the prison becomes a character
It casts its shadow over most of the film its tall stone walls stretching above every shot
It towers over the men it contains blotting out all memories of the outside world
Only Andy LRB Robbins RRB holds onto hope
It s in music it s in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo In here s where you need it most he says
You need it so you do nt forget
Forget that there are places in the world that are nt made out of stone
That there s a there s a there s something inside that s yours that they ca nt touch
Red LRB Morgan Freeman RRB does nt think much of Andy at first picking that tall glass o milk with the silver spoon up his ass as the first new fish to crack
Andy says not a word and losing his bet Red resents him for it
But over time as the two get to know each other they quickly become the best of friends
This again is one of the film s major strengths
Many movies are about love many flicks have a sidekick to the hero but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends
It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again when it s a feeling that weighs so much into everyone s day to day lives
Perhaps it s too sentimental to seem conventional but Shawshank s core friendship hits all the right notes and the film is much better for it
It s pacing is deliberate as well
As we spend the film watching the same actors it is easy to forget that the movie s timeline spans well over years
Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality and would only be amplified in prison
And it s not as if the film lacks interest in these moments
It still knows where it s going it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there
It pays off as well as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating
For anyone who sees it it is a moment never to be forgotten
With themes of faith and hope there is a definite religious subtext to be found here
Quiet selfless and carefree Andy is an obvious Christ figure
Warden Norton LRB Bob Gunton RRB is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon who in his day was as close to a personified Satan as they come
But if you are nt looking for subtexts the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope
It is a compelling drama and a very moving film perfectly written acted and shot
They just do nt come much better than this
OVERALL SCORE A The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well
More than any film in memory it proved there is life after box office
Besting Forrest and Fiction it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of
It currently sits at in the IMDb s Top Films occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time redemption indeed
If you have nt seen it yet what the hell are you waiting for
As Andy says It comes down a simple choice really
Either get busy living or get busy dying
The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie
There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing
Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema
I believe that one reason that this movie is underappreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times
On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances
However this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose
The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks
Because of Andy Red can find a different paththe path of freedom that is lit by hope
Who is your Andy Dufresne
I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film and I m about to tell you why
Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a city banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover
He is sent to Shawshank Prison in and receives a double life sentence for the crime
Andy forms an unlikely friendship with Red LRB Morgan Freeman RRB the man who knows how to get things
Andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes
The story unfolds
I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director
The acting was world class
I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe LRB eg Seven RRB
The twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it was nt even slightly pretentious or cliched it was original
The cinematography was grand and expressive
It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison
But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films is the attention given to the story
The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels
It s a powerful poignant thoughtprovoking challenging film like no other
If Andy were to comment on this film I think he might say Get busy watching or get busy dying
Take his advice
One of my all time favorites
Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship
The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively
And James Whitmore s portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving
The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film
As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair
If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it
As I bet you ll want to see this one more than once
One of the finest films made in recent years
It s a poignant story about hope
Hope gets me
That s what makes a film like this more than a movie
It tells a lesson about life
Those are the films people talk about or even years from you
It s also a story for freedom
Freedom from isolation from rule from bigotry and hate
Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances
Each learns from the other
Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another
There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as BrooksHe shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink
Stephen King s story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement
It is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in or years
He shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink
Stephen King s story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement
It is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in or years
Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one now you can add Shawshank to that list
This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly wo nt be the last
The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that
as of this date and I m sure it could be number
So I ll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is
But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it
King is one of the best writers in the world
Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told
But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors
The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner
Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever
He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully
What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys
It is one of eternal hope
Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit
But he never loses hope
He never gives up his quest to become a free man again
His years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live
This film has a different feel to it
There has never been anything like it before and I do nt know if there will again
I m not going to say any more about this film it has already been said but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in
I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won
It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come
The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen
Similar to The Green Mile in many respects LRB and better than it in almost all of them RRB these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart
The plot is average but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction and the acting is so toprate it s almost scary
Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane wrongly imprisoned for years for the murder of his wife
The story focuses on Andy s relationship with Red Redding LRB Morgan Freeman in probably his best role RRB and his attempts to escape from Shawshank
Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton and there are great performances and cameos all around the most prominent one being Gil Bellows LRB late as Billy of Ally McBeal RRB as Tommy a fellow inmate of Andy s who suffers under the iron will of Norton
This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick
It has a great and deep message
This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope
Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal
Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever
He was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive
His performance just made me smile
Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover
He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope
In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman
Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope
He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed
His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all
With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing
Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red s group
James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized
The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent
He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography
He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance
Whatever you do do nt listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever
It has everything you could possibly want
Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends I do not even refer to it by title but rather as The Movie
When I say The Movie my friends know exactly what I m talking about
In fact the main reason that me and my friends do nt refer to it by title is because this movie is so great that we do not feel worthy enough to say it s name in vain
I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption
Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those Budget Theaters over the summer of
None of us really knew anything about the movie but we had heard that it was pretty good
So not having any real expectations we saw it
When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor
I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life
There s really no other way I can put it in words
Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life HOPE
This movie is sad uplifting inspiring harsh cold funny LRB at the right times RRB jawdropping and heartwarming all at the same time
I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending LRB which takes place over the last minutes or so RRB in movie history
How it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting
I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan
The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie no matter how many I may see
I ve seen many movies over the past few years many excellent films
However every time I walk out of the theater I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say That was a great movie but it was nt nearly as good as you know what
There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my favorite of all time but they ve all fallen far short of The Shawshank Redemption
So if you have yet to see this movie please run to the video store immediately
You re guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section
And if it is nt in that section then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them
If you have seen this movie go see it again
If you have nt bought your own copy yet buy one
In fact buy two and put one in a fireproof safe just in case of an emergency
oRRB So you want a rating I give it a I m trying to save you money this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing
Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks just plunk down the and own the title
You ll wind up going back to this gem time and time again
This is one of few movies that are truly timeless
And it s entertaining and moving no matter how many times you view it
Forget about what others LRB including myself RRB might suggest you ll discover in The Shawshank Redemption when you watch it you ll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene a character or a moment in this uncomplicated movie
When you need hope you ll look for Shawshank
When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you ca nt find in movies today
Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening
Of course some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity but most places of worship are open only certain days or times
But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances Shawshank will give it to you
It makes grown men LRB like me RRB cry still
I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward
Nominated for seven this is the best film that never one a single Oscar
How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system
Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne
Prejudging this classic film critics could nt get past the title
The public followed suit initially dismissing Shawshank which failed in the box office just like It s a Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane
It could have just whithered away on the store shelves like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell
But the characters prevailed because Andy And Shawshank stayed true
Now these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time
Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies or the film s title or how a hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people
Shawshank has not one explosion
I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally enhancedframe
But every aspect of Shawshank fit together
The acting from the top to the bit part
The musical score
The editing
The photography
The story from opening credits to final scene
All involved including the town of Mansfield Ohio LRB where Shawshank was actually filmed RRB played their roles perfectly
Shawshank is a must see must own title
The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont
It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne LRB Robbins RRB a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover
Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis Red Redding LRB Freeman RRB
While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker
However the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them
There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in with a title that did nt give much inkling to anyone about what it was aboutand with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office
However come Academy Award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release
The rest as they say is history
For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic
Something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors
One thing is for sure tho is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away
It s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms
The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion
But when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that s dealing in hope friendship and faith
The sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist
Cosy prison life you say
No chance
The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely
And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins LRB never better RRB Freeman LRB sublimely making it easy RRB it s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red
Those in support are nt faring too bad either
Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the Birdman Of Shawshank Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt Byron Hadley William Sadler amusing as Heywood Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond
Then there s Roger Deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters LRB yes they are ours RRB
The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too
Thomas Newman s score is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with Andy s state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart
If you love Shawshank then it s a love that lasts a lifetime
Every viewing brings the same array of emotionsangerrevilementhappinesssadnessinspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment
Above all else tho Shawshank offers hope not just for characters in a movie but for a better life and a better world for all of us
At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red the man who knows how to get things the only guilty man at Shawshank prison
He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in but did nt win
LRB Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump RRB
What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement
Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time
But Freeman is not alone
Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story banker Andy Dufresne who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover
Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays
It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing
I believe this is the best performance of his career but it might be compared with his work in The Player LRB RRB another excellent movie and in Mystic River LRB RRB for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor
It is said that every good story needs a villain and in the Biblequoting Biblethumping massively hypocritical sadistic Warden Samuel Norton played perfectly by Bob Gunton we have a doozy
I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed
They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent predatory homosexual behavior LRB which is the reason the movie is rated R RRB
On the wall of his office LRB hiding his safe with its illgotten contents and duplicitous accounts RRB is a framed plaque of the words His judgment cometh and that right soon
The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect
You will take delight I promise
Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you
As most people know it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption
Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell
The poster is a still from the film Gilda LRB RRB starring her and Glenn Ford
We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears
If you have nt seen her check out that old movie
She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe who next appears on Andy s wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch LRB RRB
It s the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs
Following her on Andy s wall LRB and by the way these pinups figure prominently in the plot RRB is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years BC LRB RRB
In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining awayFrank Darabont s direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story
There is Brooks LRB James Whitmore RRB who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he ca nt cope with life on the outside and hangs himself
Playing off of this is Red s periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED
Watch how this plays out at the end
The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent
The editing superb there s not a single dead spot in the whole movie
The difference between the good guys LRB Red Andy Brooks etc RRB and the bad guys LRB the warden the guards the sisters etc RRB is perhaps too starkly drawn and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic and perhaps the redemption is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out
But never mind
We love it
All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul
It is not a chick flick and that is an understatement
It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck
This film has had such an emotional impact on me I find it hard to write comments on it
I ve read a lot of the previous comments all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it s overrated or cliched
Most have got good points to make however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is so loved
Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film
It s about Red
He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy he s not only trapped in a prison not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving not only does he have no hope he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him he could nt cope
He s safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going
Hope is as Red say dangerous
The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it
A large proportion of those do nt understand what s wrong but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer
Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely do nt understand what s going on in those who do
They re too busy living
In this film or as some people have quite correctly said this fairytale magic wands exist
And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini
However this film is not about him
Neither is it about the prison the governor the guard the plot the acting the cinematography the script the direction or the score
Many people in this world are unhappy
Most people in this world do nt want to be unhappy
Lots of people wish pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears losses angers and pains once and for all
They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state while they suffer
To borrow the words of another film they re watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside th e prison is nt all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing
Some of it is rocky and uncertain
Fairytales do nt get this far
They d end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say and he lived happily ever after
This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store
In other words they re not going to cheat you and tell you everything s going to be alright
This is crucial
For two and half hours those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy s mapped out on the screen
And it s a real way out
It s hard and upsetting but ultimately rewarding
The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine
So yes this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it is nt realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list it is a bit overrated
However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved altered and improved the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one
We have all see movies comedies action and dramas
We all liked ones hated others got into some other even and felt like part of it
In Shawshank Redemption you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else
then comes a last minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics
I felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of I felt I was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfied Probably yes acting was good plot brilliant I mean Stephen King wrote the book but it ca nt match the film
When I sow this movie I thought thats it this is it best movie ever
Sure you can find people who did nt like it and when I ask why and try to guess what then happened
They just confused themselves they can say reason why they do nt like this movie When I try to read comments with star I ca nt find comment with good reasons that could make me realize that this movie is a bad movie If there is no reason then this means that its the best movie ever madeThe only reason people are giving star is that they do nt like ratio they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down I really hate them RRB Sorry for my bad English language I live in EUrope my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen
Andy Dufresne wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover finds the strength not only to change himself but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison
This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful
When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph
Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me
Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity
It does nt pretend to be clean nor could it be called a family movie
It is brutal and violent at times horrifying and sickening at others
However the title says it all
Redemption is what this story is all about
And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life
What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art
This is what movies were meant to be
In recent years the IMDB top movies has had THE GODFATHER at number while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number
The only exception was early in when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number for a couple of more months
I ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I do nt think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high What I do nt like about it is the amount of cliches
New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food prison cliche
New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird prison cliche
It s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all prison cliche numero uno
Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty
Neither did I
Maybe that s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty
There s other things wrong with the movie
It s about half an hour overlong and there s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent
Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man
Maybe that last point should nt be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie
Neither of them give a flashy performance LRB Again not a criticism RRB but both are very subtle in their roles can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars
Perhaps because Freeman s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he s so good in the role
Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who s black
There s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont
Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces
It s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman s score When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was on the top movies of all time I thought Yea I could understand that
I do nt necessarily agree that it s absolutely the best but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top
It is the story of Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison
It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity
It s funny because I do nt really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular
The performances are very good but nothing really noteworthy
The characters all serve the story beautifully but none of them really stand out from the others
Frank Darabont is great the shots are exactly what they should be
Almost the entire film is shot at the prison adding to the feeling of isolation and routine
And yet we are captivated from the outset
Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I d pay to hear it his narration breathes life into every scene that it s spoken over
The real beauty of this film is it s story mostly about Andy and Red LRB Robbins and Freeman RRB but it s the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery
Stephen King s novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror but a true literary genius
Sure he does nt use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters but does anyone tell as good a story
King alwys gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you ca nt help but get swept away
The Shawshank Redemption is no different
If there is a film by which other films should be judged this is as good as it can get
Powerful engaging visceral despairing a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human
It s one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive
A friend of mine listed The Shawshank Redemption as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was I even thought it was a typo
The next day I went out and brought home the years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile and a half hours of my life in front of the TV LRB a melodrama does nt kill right RRB
I do nt know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better
I remembered crying a few times being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone inert and all just because of the onceinalifetime beauty of Shawshank
Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on all the cons stood paral yzed on the ground listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before
Shawshank is more than a feel good movie it s about lifechanging experiences about the endless struggle against life s harshness and unfairness about true friends who will stand by you forever The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this
I first saw this film like many others by chance and on DVD
And like others I have since watched it over and over again
When I feel sad it makes me feel happy when I need hope it gives me hopeWhen I want to reaffirm my very belief in life and all it can offer this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doingIt soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself
The portrayal of friendship the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope
Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great
The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls
Thank you Mr Darabont Mr Robins and Mr Freeman
Thank you to every one else involved
You changed my life I have seen this movie around times and sure will watch more then times before i die
of the best movies i have ever seen in my life
Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life Movie has some great lines
When Andy LRB Tim Robins RRB brake the Jail Morgon Freeman says I have to remind myself that some birds are nt meant to be caged
Their feathers are just too bright This movie has entertainment Feelings Action Drama a little comedy
In short everything we want to see in a movie
This is Tim Robbins best performance ever
It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man LRB Andy Dufresbe RRB who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life
He meets a mentor in Red LRB Morgan Freeman RRB and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them
Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison
Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners but also of the prison guards
Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom
They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind
At this writing this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made
The SECOND BEST EVER MADE
The acting is good
Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition
But these are not truly great actors and in any case they are only asked to play appealing persons deliberately lessdimensional than real LRB as opposed to believably hyperreal which is much harder RRB
The director is a firsttimer and it shows
There is simple framing and staging here
In fact there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible
And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film
The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow
All the chunks are the same size with no fancy rhythm
There is no distracting backstory
No element has irony not writing acting shooting even the score Now for me I expect and demand art in my films that s why I register this as plain
But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense
It is straight and honest people seem hungry for honesty and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right timeIs a film great because it merely fulfills
I hope many people think not and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts
Like I did a few years back you might be hesitating about watching this film
The title did nt appeal to me and neither did the subject matter so it was only by chance that I started to watch it
I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since
There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which whilst they leave an impression leave the wrong one ie that there is no hope in life
Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message that there is ALWAYS hope in any situation
I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings
When I thought about it though it made more sense this is a Rocky type feelgood movie that does nt really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature
Do nt get me wrong it s a fine film LRB I gave it a solid out of RRB it s just not in my view up there with Casablanca and The Graduate
I guess the main problem I have with Shawshank is the nature of the script and characters
Think about it is there a single person in the film who is nt a one dimensional cardboard cutout with very simple motivations or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype
We have LRB in no particular order RRB a corrupt bigoted prison warden LRB who is a religious hypocrite for good measure RRB a brutal prison guard a man who is wrongly accused of murder an old convict who knows all the ropes and ca nt live on the outside and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards
Now where have we seen this stuff before
Only in a few dozen movies made from the s to the s
There s really nothing new here
Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King who does nt really do well with complex characters LRB a problem I noted as far back as Carrie RRB
If you want to see a good prison picture try Cool Hand Luke LRB from which this movie borrows considerably RRB
If you want an escape picture see either The Great Escape or Papillon both with Steve McQueen
Or if by some chance you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think go with the late great Stanley Kubrick s A Clockwork Orange
I could nt stop thinking about the warden does nt he have a family
How did they feel
What are they going to do now
I realize the story is inside the prison but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simpleminded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE
I m not Mr Cranky I did enjoy the movie but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden a wellconstructed genre product with nothing special to commend it
I still ca nt quite get the enormous reputation of this film
I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery the mystery got thicker
It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman James Whitmore etc but the most highly rated film ever
I do nt get it
The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film
I love Morgan Freeman s voice but he s telling us what we re seeing
So the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never really arrives
The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins s psychological journey
Credible or incredible does nt quite matter I did go with him without asking too many questions
Morgan Freeman s humanity is contagious and inspiring whether credible or not because I bought it
So a masterpiece
No
Good even very good
Yes
If you have never seen SHAWSHANK this review is aimed primarily at you
I suppose there must be some of you out there What is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the years since its release
In a Perfect World SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice
What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements
It is the exception that proves the Murphy s Law rule
Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote In every area of human activity there is always that
SHAWSHANK is no exception
Precisely of voters rated SHAWSHANK Star
I invite you to check
In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of longterm wrongful imprisonment
Make that a Universal scenario perhaps in ALL cultures
Not a SPOILER here because this point is clearly established in the opening minutes
SHAWSHANK is the ultimate BlackWhite BROmance Yet uniquely Morgan Freeman s character Red is anything but the predestined to an untimely end sidekick The entire film is literally narrated from Red s perspective
If anything Red s MainMan prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship
But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of equals gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS
I ca nt help but wonder if while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in
Box Office results are rather jaw dropping but in a negative sense Opening Weekend A starkly paltry Position among releases of just K US
Overall Box Office did not even make the Top
SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot to be exact with just over Million taken in
My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer but I had to go by myself My wife who is a rather avid movie goer said Hmmmm a prison drama
What s the Title
After hearing it she responded The SHAWWhat
No Thanks I PASS
Well needless to say after a first viewing my awe was complete and unmitigated so I insisted on dragging her along just days later for my second viewing
My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer
We both categorize this film in our lifetime top favorites
Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife not going to see it in
I could literally write volumes on this movie but of course can not here
A few more highlights Interestingly Oscar Nominations but ZER wins
Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel good classic FORREST GUMP which steamrolled that year with Oscars and at the Box Office with Million about X SHAWSHANK s
Wonder what the Academy s members take on this would be today
Just look at the categories where it was nominated Each one is exquisitely superb
Not a single Golden Statuette WOW
As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned in the selfcontained and totally insulated prison environment it is nt much of a stretch to imagine an OldTestament thumping warden anointing himself with almost god like powers
Stranger things have happened yes
In one odd twist when one thinks of Illegal Immigration Mexico or Central America to the USA invariably is the route that comes to mind not the opposite right When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption I was in a movie theater on a week night at around pm
I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift
I was tired and just wanted a little amusement
This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention
I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me
I half reluctantly chose to watch it
That night I was not prepared to be blown away
I did nt see a movie I was transported by a story
I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with
I was nt just entertained I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner
If this film remains on IMDb s number one spot for a long time to come It s well deserves it
To me personally the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the s were an interesting decade but more than that why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status
There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R one if you have nt seen it do nt let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot Do nt listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you
Two make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film no phone calls no door bells no other plans
Watch it from beginning to end
You ca nt over hype this film it s just that good
What i ve written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film
Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb
Well I guess I m a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture
I ve seen it a couple of times but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb
When I first discovered this site a few years ago The Godfather was in the Number spot and since then the films have traded places for first and second with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time
That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight and I ve come away from the picture with a new found appreciation
My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way shape or form and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like On The Waterfront To Kill a Mockingbird and One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest
I may have to reconsider that list an infrequent exercise but one I do nt mind doing every now and then as situations warrant
Overall the film is darn near perfect
I know it s pretty clich to state it that way but when you analyze the dialog the characters the directing and the tone of the movie the picture flows flawlessly even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen s release and new prisoner Tommy s introduction late in the picture
Every setup every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy s quest for escape and personal redemption
Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon
How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face
The story transcends one man s confinement for a crime he did nt commit and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control
Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in s Cool Hand Luke but his method was self destructive
Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so
But even more so you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding LRB Morgan Freeman RRB a convict who sees Andy as a person and over time an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend
From Andy he comes to understand that even as a prisoner a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness
Not bad for a convict who started out believing that hope can drive a man insane
I really ca nt recommend this picture highly enough both for it s masterful story telling and it s technical execution
The actors even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles
They deliver a seamless performance that s virtually unmatched by most modern films in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance
It s times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf
It s been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad the worst review I ve given in weeks was a to Flightplan
This film obviously did nt break my streak
I went into it knowing next to nothing only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time that it was based on a story by Stephen King and that it took place in a prison
Needless to say it blew me away
I wont say a thing about the plot just so that others who ve yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me
I will say this though It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see
One in particular stands out above the rest
Not much can be said about the actors that has nt been said
Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career and even though I ve only seen or other Tim Robbins movies I m sure the same can be said for him Though I do nt agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made it was still a very good very well made very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film
At first before starting the movie I thought Sounds like a typical prison riot and breakout kind of movie
At the beginning of the movie my thoughts was even more convincing
A large prison LRB Which immediately reminded me of the movie The Last Castle from RRB housing people of all sorts having it s guards warden and of course the inmates
The typical inmate Roughneck hard on the outside broken on the inside
And they all claim their innocence as an internal joke sort of speak
It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others
That proved wrong in quite a short while from the point where a prisoner framed for murder of his wife and her lover is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison
His name was Andy Dufresne
In short terms a straightup bank employee excellent with numbers and taxes which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison
His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out and soon all kinds of people inmates and guards are coming to him for financial advice
He builds up a library he maintains a strict surface
He has his hobbies to keep his mind busy LRB as said in the movie RRB
He carves chess pieces out of stone using an axe as the tool
Seemingly this is a nice and lucrative hobby but underneath it all he has a secret The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited because in every minute something could happen
The dialog is good Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both great actors shows and outstanding play
The crew really did good work on the set the right camera angles the light sounds and so on it was almost like I could smell the prison
This is the best movie I have ever seen
In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself
Restricted to doing certain things
Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free
I hope and dream for it sometime
This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much
I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie
Although critics say Tim Robbins did nt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role
I am glad to visit IMDb
I never heard of it before
Some years ago I saw it at no in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately
Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane
But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom
As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me
I believe movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination and movie narrows down the imagination it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book
But Believe me this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption which I rate as the best movie I have ever seenFor the first time in history the book LRB the Stephen King Novella RRB has been defeated by its movie versionAfter watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book I thought wowthe movie is so good how will be the book
To tell U frankly the book is good but the movie is bestThere are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the bookSome examples are The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphoneThe narration goes on like
I did nt understand a single word that Italian lady was singing but I tell U
for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free The scene just fill my heart with Andy s yearn for freedom I was kinda shocked when I did nt find it in the original book version
I can remember another sceneWhile Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book Alexandre Dumas as DumbAss
Andy says its not Dumb ass its Dumas
and U may like the book
The Count of Monty Cristo its about a jailbreakAnd the category it falls is Fiction Then Red says
Why do nt we put it on Educational category
LRB Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as Educational category RRB
As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books I was hysteric watching this sophisticated jokeThis was also not in the book
This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends
And after they watch it they always thank me
Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie
I would also like to say
Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
Thanx to all
There are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing
I can happily say that The Shawshank Redemption has stuck to me since I finished watching it for the first time and instantly rocketed up my Top Films list
Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out not so in Shawshank at least not to me
The hefty run time does nt put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again
Shawshank is one of those films that I would love to experience for the first time all over again
The thrill of emotions and the highs and lows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else
In my opinion Forrest Gump was not as deserving of the Best Picture Oscar as this
The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come
Shawshank Redemption is a truly A Class movie that teaches us many things like friendship and never gave up your hope
Unlike other users I think this movie deserves to be in IMDb Top list
Today IMDb s Top List approved and considered by everyone
So everybody must see that this movie is in top and must watch it to see why IMDb puts this movie on top and not Godfather
I really like the role of Red by Morgan Freeman
He really acts like a experienced jailmate
Andy Dufresne is okay too
What I really like is that I really love the end
Maybe this is the best ending ever
I really like how Red laughs to Andy about pickaxe and Andy dig years LRB WOW RRB
to made a hole in the wall how he escape and become a person he made it up for Warden s dirty job how his dreams come true and lastly after years in jail after Andy escaped how Red not decided to suicide decided to follow Andy
There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit
Shawshank is one of those movies
I do nt care what anyone s take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal this movie is moving
There are three movies in my opinion that every man or developing man should watch Shawshank Redemption Dancing With Wolves and Brave Heart
Unless you are a total pansy these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality
Andy Dufrane is the person in us
Red is the person we want to be
Aside from the being in prison the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation
An analysis of prison life and of what hope can be in a prison Frank Darabont s first film is one of the best ever
Wellwritten and wellacted the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming endearing poignant
Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous it s simply extraordinary drama
A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point but
One user put it very well when they said that the film s essential message of the human spirit conquering all is very uplifting an everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily
One user put it very well when they said that the film s essential message of the human spirit conquering all is very uplifting an everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily
Like I said I m not dissing the film
it IS great
From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged LRB Freeman is excellent but then what s new RRB
the direction is perfect because it s so unobtrusive to the story and the film in general is uplifting
I just think it s nothing particularly new and it has been done better
Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release
I gave it an
To me this fact proves that I love the film just not as much as everybody else seems to
I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story which was also excellent
I honestly ca nt agree with on the top list though
Is it just an American overreaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it
Please feel free to email me for discussion on this or anything else for that matter
Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full
As you ve come this far and you re a bit of a film fan you go to see a film you ve heard nothing about
I did this years ago with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed
hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person before I had not been moved by a film I did nt care if Indiana Jones made it Sonny Corleone got wacked Fred married Ginger ET got home
Before films were either plot driven or character driven they were action or comedy sad or happy a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed respected or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person
Shawshank was different there were characters I believed not just one or two but virtually all
Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of people Red and Andy
I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope
This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies
I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way
I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film
I have seen it many times and will see it many more
Like a beautifully crafted French wine this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year
Every time I have viewed it over the past decade LRB and it must be at least more than times by now RRB I have found newer shades subtler indications and deeper meanings
And it has amazed me like very few have
No overacting Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank Method in the madness of running the scams from inside The complete secrecy maintained for years LRB not even Red knew RRB
The best that a highlyeducated intellectual could do inside such a prison What a great actor the Warden turned out to be totally despicable
What a bunch of speakable quotes
what a bunch
Totally recommended for any young person students especially HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS a message that shines through Despair or determination crying or fighting obedience or inner freedom resignation or patience fear or hope difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings
Experience makes us richer hardship makes us stronger friendship makes us better
Although we may be deprived of everything only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity These words ring the bell for the majority of people yet seldom do they appear so unique so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION the story appears to be unlike any other movie unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King s stories onto screen unlike most productions of the world cinema
Why
I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself
What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that in a way refers to this question
What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy LRB Tim Robbins RRB the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign
At the spot where for many people life actually ends for Andy a new tedious struggle begins
Quickly befriended by Red LRB Morgan Freeman RRB actually the narrator of the story both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances within the hell on earth they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom Here let me refer to Roger Ebert s words who nicely described the character of Andy he says that Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him
Indeed salvation lies within discipline for himselfdiscipline Except for some other plots including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams LRB Gil Bellows RRB and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen LRB James Whitmore RRB it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie
It is as a matter of fact the story of their friendship their dreams expressed at the wall of despair
They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers
Here a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts towards his reflections and his perception of the events his the prisoner s
Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality
Here it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film
Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer
We as observers truly know what world we are led to yet there is no loss of hope
The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience
With Thomas Newman s terrific music score consisting of dark piano music we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill
Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison LRB mind you the almost claustrophobic effect RRB one can not skip The Letter Duet scene when the excerpt of Mozart s The Marriage of Figaro is being played
The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony by the blissful moment of magnificence
At this moment I was breathless and really second the powerful line Music makes you free
The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way
There are no clich s which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap
Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman
He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights
Ironically he portrays a resocialized character in fact richer inside than any corrupted decency
Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before
And Bob Gunton as a true villain the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory
To sum it up I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time patience and harmony I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves to the most extent themselves
There within the harshest reality Because only there we truly behave according to our rules
There we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible
A redemptive masterpiece a masterful redemption desperate Brooks was here and so was Red yet he brought a new dawn for dreams a new dawn for friendship Will he succeed
If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film then it is excellent LRB RRB because it truly gets you involved in its main character
It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and wellacted buddystory at its core
It delicately and sometimes brutally juxtaposes Andy Dufresne s LRB Tim Robbins RRB goodnatured character with the harshness of prison life projecting so much heart in doing soHowever delightful as it is The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance
It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches it s only a very safe buddystory
A damn good one but still just that
So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied because what will it be remembered for
Friendship
Huh neat
I therefore do nt think it s entirely deserving of being considered the greatest film of all time on IMDbcom
But moving on and looking past that it is possibly one of my alltime favourite films for the feelings it leaves
Sure it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story
On top of that it never falls prey to predictable sappiness probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship
It is so wellsewn together by a feelgood narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film
This film is a modern classic
Why
Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story and that is all films really are storytelling
The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise
That may well be the easy option but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered
It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts and will be passed down by many generations
This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it
You are there in that prison suffering when Andy does smiling when Andy does
Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever
He is simply superb
Plus Morgan Freeman well would we expect anything less from a man with such talent
It is this relationship between Andy LRB Robbins RRB and Red LRB Freeman RRB which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind
We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex
Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together
Shawshank for once tells the tale of two men who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness
Their friendship is portrayed free of sex yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending
Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful
The plot is also perfectly timed
I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on
Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces but also keeps the story turning and turning as if it has a heart beat pumping more and more of the story line unwinding the plot before your open jaw
Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing
Again i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in just to look cool or higher the rating
Swearing in that context seems unnatural and therefore disjointed
However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural and all part of the atmosphere of the prison Finally i think everyone should see this film
This is a pure yet thrilling tale of hope friendship and belief
The story is executed brilliantly with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum you become Andy and go through his struggles with him and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion
I guarantee by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen you jaw will be open your mind will be blown and your heart will be broken into pieces
This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece
The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it
Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar LRB a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby RRB
There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face
In fact the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes
If there is any drawback to this movie it is that it is a shade too long meaning it s often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV
Rent this or better yet buy it to get the full thrust of it
Definitely on my personal top
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good
or in this case brilliant
Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the s I can easily imagine it being transferred to today s time and standards
The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors LSB and writers of course RSB did nt use extreme clich s there s no black and white painting just numerous shades of grey
Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles as are all of the supporting actors
All is perfect the complexity of the characters the suspense the principals themes like friendship loneliness injustice redemption vengeance freedom The most complete movie that i ve ever seen
Tim Robbins is great sensitive brilliant in one scene he can feel a thousand of feelings
Freeman is very correct and seems to be really Red
Gunton Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace
Titanic is pure entertainment and received oscars
This movie deserves oscars because it shows what is really important in life
No action more realistic more useful than the other films
It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it
When i see it again I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema s industry have
In a different way only Star Wars Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact
My life is forever changed due to this movie
It is a movie of hope redemption and friendship
It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners Andy and Red
They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison
As time passes hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy
His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red
This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light
For some of those people time will tell
As for now I ll be patient to wait and see
Do nt end up like Brooks there will always be someone to help you out
There is someone out there that cares for you
Thank you Andy Dufresne your hope is the flame of my life
As Red s long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel
Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom and he follows it
Since I bought LRB a lot of years ago RRB a videotape with two Stephen King s short films one of them The Woman In The Room directed by Frank Darabont I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry and here we are with another King s story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade LRB s RRB of course with the help of nonetheless but mr Freeman and mr Robbins who could have spoiled it

I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time
I was yearsold and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a school night
So naturally I say to my father Dad I think it s time to watch Shawshank
I almost regret watching it
It is that good
It s like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that The Shawshank Redemption takes you on
First question I usually ask people when discussing films is So have you seen Shawshank
No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time
If they say yes I have something to talk to them about for the next minutes
You probably still wo nt believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see
It s that good that I actually told one of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed
Then she will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to it
Now when I see a movie all I think is I ve already seen the best
Now actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece LRB not that any summary of the plot could ever do it justice RRB
So all I will say is this I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review
Do yourself a favour and do nt even bother to finish reading this
Just go and watch it
To tell the truth I am speechless
I am a young movie fanatic in fact this film came out the same year I was born and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects edgeofyourseat action et cetera
This film has none of that and yet it appeals so closely to me
The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story the beauty of the soundtrack used LRB note the harmonica used just before Red s finding of the letter close to the end RRB
The entire film from beginning to end from actions to sound is a beacon of hope judgement and redemption
The cast is perfect Morgan Freeman LRB Red RRB actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale and that is exactly what the movie is what a movie should be
Highly recommended for every viewer no matter your taste LRB or age
judgement excludes use of language or violence RRB
I ca nt say it deserved its nO position i ca nt say any movie does but if any movie should this one might as well be it
I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film
The pacing directing and storyline holds interest throughout along with a superb supporting cast and a very moving ending
The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife
Later on in the movie the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent
However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it does nt matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary
This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff
In this facility you must use all of the intellect you can both book smarts and street smarts to not only stay alive but prevent yourself from going insane within the system
Andy befriends Red a fellow inmate played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance
He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank s hellhole
Andy an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a basic skills learning facility within the prison s library
Red helps him organize this and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie
Another inmate is the head librarian known as Brooks who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie
What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters especially Andy and Red are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the peoAs good as this movie is I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films
However I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption
Watch the Sean Penn Movie Bad Boys for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison
LRB Interestingly Clancy Brown who plays the bad officer in Shawshank is just as good as a prison bully in Bad Boys RRB
Another great movie is Midnight Express which is LRB although loosely RRB based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in
This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling momentsple who run it
There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life such as fighting and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all
The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse because they need to do this in order to keep living
They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them
A great quote in this film is
you can get busy living or you can get busy dying
Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go
An underlining message is that whether you get busy living or dying you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world and the struggles to reach it to become physically and mentally free are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination
I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to but no better than Midnight Express or Bad Boys
This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie
I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that do nt get the same credit that this movie does
Call this movie the greatest ever and you have to do the same for Midnight Express or Bad Boys
All three films have the same emotional impact
Another under rated movie that you should see is An Innocent Man which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King s more restrained kind of stories dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends
TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN LRB who plays the narrator with great dignity RRB describes himself as the only guilty man in Shawshank
The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape
Along the way he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish
But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there s a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing
A touch of irony here no
The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale but still they make an impact because of all that happens before
It s a bittersweet story a sort of horrific fairytale of what might have happened but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful storytelling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay
To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all
This is a film that when I watched it the first time I could nt believe how good it was
I expected a film that would pass the time by and I got a film that I could identify with
If you are feeling sad and you think the world s a rubbish place this fills you with hope
I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison and then the music kicks in it makes you feel aweinspired
The acting was brilliant you believed what everyone said LRB some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness that it makes you want to throw up RRB
I have watched Spiderman and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing they just sound good
The film and book reciprocated the message Hope Springs Eternal which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better things might change for us and hope never dies I think when Tim Robbins speaks about music how you can never take it away because it s in your head
If I have a rubbish day at work then it s true that music just lifts you which is reemphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison LRB this of example of piece of script which means so much RRB
The movie uses music to it s full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters
This film can not replicated because the film is a piece of art the Director wanted to make money but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something that had some effect on you after the movie was over
The movie has no bad points it s what a story should be about it takes you somewhere that you nether been and makes you feel you lived that experience and you can learn from that experience
The lines delivered will always be remembered Get busy living or get busy dying LRB this is the dilemma we face in everyday live RRB
This will live in my memories forever not like the sorry cashins of movies Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen
It is the only movie I ve seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes
I would LRB and do RRB recommend this film to anyone and everyone
Now I see what everybody was talking about
It took me years to see this in my opinion masterpiece
If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can
The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are to me the pinnacle of both their careers
This film can not help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity
You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny
Robbins LRB Andy RRB and Freeman LRB Red RRB are a balance of the human spirit
Andy is your freedomseeking hope side and Red is your rational pessimistic counterpart
Find your equilibrium in The Shawshank Redemption
Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time I really did nt think much of it
I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the spot here on IMDb and could nt be better than The Godfather for example
A movie that was cool to like if you will
I could imagine fashion conscious moviehipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages
You get the idea
I m sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments
That said the reason I m posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption is nt only a hardcore movie freak s wet dream
While it s brilliantly written has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont you really do nt have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it
It appeals to so many different groups of people and so many different human feelings at the same time
The weaknesses it had as it came out LRB the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population RRB is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all It offers something for everyone
From the director of s Buried Alive comes perhaps the strongest drama of
The Shawshank Redemption is emotionally fulfilling in every way uplifting its audience again and again
Darabont s screenplay adapted from LRB and expanded upon RRB Stephen King s short novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is at once soul stirring heartrending and disarmingly funny
As director Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising LRB largely unpredictable thank goodness RRB script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writerdirector can ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface
Startling performances from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production
As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly
He s a man who not only strongly believes he has a future but that it s a good one
Freeman is spot on as the world weary Red the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise LRB whatever you want RRB to other inmates
He is gradually transformed and always surprised by Andy s optimism geniality and brilliance
In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents
The cinematography is superb capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful if not crucial scenes
In this light the editing team have done a marvellous jobwhile Thomas Newman s music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition
What makes this film so effective is Darabont s brilliant script and astute direction coupled with the strong acting and great support production
Darabont achieves all his objectives making us laugh cry listen and think he both surprises and inspires us many times
We re left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding
A definite triumph of the human spirit
Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic but certainly not expected and that s what makes this story so great
The Shawshank Redemption comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history
Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to
Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden LRB Bob Gunton RRB and the despicable ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards LRB Clancy Brown RRB
The Shawshank Redemption was the surprise of from director Frank Darabont
Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant it is by far the best prison film I ve ever seen
Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing
Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman s score is sweeping and melodic
For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you ca nt go past The Shawshank Redemption
this an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable years dug in the jail without no body know and abbreviation this is a great movie and this is form a few great movies you will see it in your life and is to be enough the writer was the greatest writer in the world Stephen king Tim Robinson give all he have in this film and Morgan free man he give unforgettable part in his Lief and how was believe the bad and strong officer at the end crying and they take him to punshid him above he did and Tim Robinson pushed the administrator of the jail to suicide after he take all his money this movie i will ca nt forget it for along time he will be in my memory for ever I really liked this movie which I just recently saw for the first time strange indeed since it is more than years old
It reminded me naturally I would say to Papillon the s McQueenHoffman classic
I like the story the acting basically everything and I definitely recommend it to everybody
But compared to Papillon
There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue
Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon
And Papillon is simply even better
It is emotionally much more touching and when even Freeman s great performance does nt match Hoffman s there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen in that role I mean
Tim gave a great performance but his role did nt give him the chance that Steve had
A film about a Stephen King story
Directed by Frank Darabont Who
Starring Tim Robbins Was nt he the guy from Howard the Duck
I admit only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie
Now the only questions I have to ask are Why did nt EVERYBODY go to see this movie
and Why did nt Morgan Freeman win the Oscar
Tom Hanks is a fine actor but he should never have beaten Morgan
Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus
Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date and Mr Darabont take a bow
Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach Perfect
This movie is one of the best I have ever seen
I first read the book and I did nt liked it that much but then I saw the movie
And that s a things that s never happened to me before the movie was better than the book
It s the other way normally
But in this case the movie is so much better I like the end more than in the book
Watch the movie it is great
The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself
It is not about a person in prison it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God
I watched the movie for the first time some months ago
That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home
Being unhappy about that I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance not knowing about its existence before that at all
At first I was skeptic I admit that
But oh God at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at AM
It gave me so much emotions and so much hope I had never felt before that
I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way so excited so happy about my life leaving me believing so much in my own self
It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do
In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak just the opposite gives you wings to fly away from fear fly closer and closer to freedom
Morgan Freeman s voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive
Tim Robbins act is just beyond perfection
I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something I watch the movie
It has become my personal shrink making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it
Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after years
Deliberately LRB some might even say slowly in places RRB paced The Shawshank Redemption alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted
There is an interesting subplot LRB which does nt take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder RRB about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration
The performances from the two leads are excellent
Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as Red the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life
Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Biblespouting but corrupt Warden Norton who uses Andy s financial expertise to enrich himself and James Whitmore as Brooks imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who unable to adjust to life on the outside yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew prison
It s an interesting twist experience also by Red later on in the movie that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution
I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy
It just did nt seem to me like something that would have happened
It also struck me as unlikely that a letter writing campaign from one solitary prisoner LRB even one that lasted six years one letter a week RRB would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library
I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded
Andy s escape also bothered me
It was too easy even though it took twenty years
And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer
Mind you the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie
The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before
Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman s Ellis Redding
Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King s short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption LRB in the film version it s really Raquel Welch not Rita who aids in the ultimate twist RRB
On the surface it s another prisongenre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden a cruel guard a few homosexuals and a quirky oldtimer who does nt want his parole
However the film s emotions run surprisingly deep justice is well served by the conclusion and several of the cast members carve out amazing three dimensional characterizations
The finale is pure fantasy however it does provide the audience with the release it needs and Robbins and Freeman are excellent
Long involved but engrossing and satisfying Shawshank was not a big hit at the boxoffice but found a devoted following on video and cable
from I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular it s quite simply beyond me
The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King s short story found it very true to the spirit of the book and voted for that
I really could not find anything worth my time in this film and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end one or two good lines of dialog and the acting there s really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for
It s about hope and the director wo nt let us forget it so it s repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep
It s like this short onenote story was written and the author just did nt want to end it so he kept writing and writing until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling for the love of all that is holy stop writing
And I thank that faceless man for doing that because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was minutes long and not or dare I say it
The film simply drones on and on scene after scene containing nothing remotely interesting LRB but with excellent acting mind you RRB
There s nothing good about this film except for the acting
Just about all of it is great
I ca nt really think of anything else to say I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King s writing
I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film
I recommend this to fans of Stephen King the actors and possibly Frank Darabont
If you re not a fan of any of these people I doubt you d find this enjoyable
There is no denying that this is a very good movie
The acting is great and it tells a good story
Personally I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste but its far from a bad filmOn the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it
To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie not because its a great one THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is very enjoyable features excellent performances and has won a fanatical following among a lot of people
I just saw it
I liked it
But as for becoming fanatically enthusiastic about it all I can say is folks let s not get carried away The story not only is incredibly simple LRB good man unjustly convicted for horrible crime maintains hope in horrible confinement RRB but is also incredibly simplistic LRB the Warden and his men are evil goons the convicts are good RRB
Complexity is something completely exiled from this story
The director Frank Durabont offers nothing new in his aesthetic choices SHAWSHANK is stock Hollywood filmmaking especially of the Spielbergian variety ala THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD
The soundtrack is overpowering in its efforts to imbue the story with heartwrenching emotion
The cinematography is fine in a sortof standardissue seen it before way
Which begs the question Is there anything truly exceptional about THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
Heck yeah Morgan Freeman proves once again that he is not only a wonderful actor but also one of the most endearing powerful presences in cinema
Tim Robbins is fine along with all of the convicts
But overall I did nt mistake THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for anything particularly new remarkable exciting in other words as anything worthy of fanatical enthusiasm
It s a fine Hollywood film that looks smells sounds and feels like your typical fine Hollywood film
But nothing more
This is it I have always been so careful on not getting carried away while watching great films and calling it the best
I am talking about the league of The Godfather Casablanca The Good The Bad The Ugly and Angry Men
So I always called each of them one of the best
I never believed THE BEST ever existed
It ca nt be right
How can anything be the best or perfect
Definitely not perfect film
There s got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough But I was wrong
Although I knew I was all the way
Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in LRB years ago RRB and I waited years thorough viewings sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film
This is the best film ever made
Spotless
True classic
And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today
Sure they are true legends
But what Frank Dorabont Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman their amazing crew did is something extra special
They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them
This film needs no further description
Ten out of ten in every department of film making
Full of incredible moments
Beauty class and intellect in almost every scene
You do not need to know the No film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art
This is the best if there is one
This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope human perseverance and friendship
I m sure there are many who believe this is nt that great but I am glad I think otherwise and believe me its a great feeling
Of having found the best film being a huge film lover
the only time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere
Why do I want to write the th comment on The Shawshank Redemption
I am not sure almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said
But like so many other people who wrote comments I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption
I did nt intend to see this movie at all I do not like prison movies and I do nt normally watch them
I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better
At the time I thought that was very strange
One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already
I remembered what she said so I watched it
I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showingThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen
I do not judge it by it s technical merits I do nt really care about that
I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made
They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best
The best movies are ones that touch the soul
It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul I watched this film and it s interesting enough but the highest rated movie on the Internet movie data base
That just proves there are a lot of people out there who do nt know a thing about the cinema
if I want pure fantasy I go to Jean Cocteau or someone like that because that s what this is pure fantasy
And pure Hollywood corn
A higher rating than the Godfathers or Vertigo or Psycho
Citizen Kane or Touch of Evil
That s a joke
Here s something to ponder In the segregated south Morgan Freeman is on the block with white prisoners Even Alcatraz was segregated until the day it closed in
The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless story of heartbreak deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions
The acting is superior some of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman s best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict s existence where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety light and shadow sanity and sorrow truth and lies injustice and justice
In fact I am lost in all the actors poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs cruel guards swindlers thieves rapists and murders all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard
In this movie I find almost no one to be all good or all bad
There are exceptions though
Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end
Like people in real life most of the characters in The Shawshank Redemption both prisoners and guards LRB those that are not miserably rotten to the bone RRB represent many shades of gray
One of the most touching moments in The Shawshank Redemption is a scene in which an elderly convict who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories
And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping
As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups economic backgrounds and intellectual levels I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share
As the story unfolds my heart hurts so hard I cry
Then with tears still in my eyes I laugh the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl
But at the core of the main character s spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range including me a contagious hope eternal
I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit
This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich s and predictability
Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities
These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you
The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film
It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forgetThese artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you This movie is one of my all time favorites
Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen
Story cast screenplay all are great
The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent
The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and could nt be more accurate
It was narrated by Morgan Freeman who is the best narrator in Hollywood I believe
Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels
It will change the way u think about things around u Surely It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man s bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope
Could a movie be any more perfect
This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways
Acting perfect storyline perfect soundtrack perfect emotional drama perfect everything about this movie is perfect
When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to
But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it s popularity grew
Eventually after many years in the top of IMDb s top movies of all time list it hit number with over one million votes The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison
As the years go on in his new home he makes friends enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history
I love this movie
The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison
The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie
Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion
The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins
And also William Sadler Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is
It s very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days
I like the story and it s conceptA thumping good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game
The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting not to mention Oscarworthy film
In it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire a film magazine
The year it came out it was nominated for academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember Forrest Gump
It s the nobull performances that hold back the flood of banalities
Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving
Some of The Shawshank Redemption comes across as outrageously improbable
Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil
In banker Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover based on circumstantial evidence and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary
Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis Red Redding LRB Morgan Freeman RRB an inmate serving a life sentence
Red procures a rock hammer for Andy allowing him to create small stone chess pieces
Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch
Andy works in the prison laundry but is regularly assaulted by the bull queer gang the Sisters and their leader Bogs LRB Mark Rolston RRB
In Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley LRB Clancy Brown RRB complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole
After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison
Andy is not attacked again
Warden Samuel Norton LRB Bob Gunton RRB meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen LRB James Whitmore RRB a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison
His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons
Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library
In Brooks is freed on parole but unable to adjust to the outside world after years in prison he hangs himself
Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro
He plays an excerpt over the public address system resulting in his receiving solitary confinement
After his release Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison can not take from him but Red dismisses the idea
In Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks
He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens
In Tommy Williams LRB Gil Bellows RRB is incarcerated for burglary
He joins Andy s and Red s circle of friends and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development LRB GED RRB examinations
In after hearing the details of Andy s case Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder suggesting Andy s innocence
Andy approaches Norton with this information but the warden refuses to listen
Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt
Andy refuses to continue with the scam but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment
After Andy is released from solitary confinement he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo a Mexican Pacific coastal town
While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic Andy instructs him should he ever be freed to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package
The next day at roll call upon finding Andy s cell empty an irate Norton throws one of Andy s rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall
The rock tears through the poster revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades
The previous night Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison s sewage pipe with Norton s ledger containing details of the money laundering
While guards search for him the following morning Andy posing as Randall Stephens visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money
Finally he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper
The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest
After serving years Red receives parole
He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will
Remembering his promise to Andy he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo
Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock Texas to cross the border to Mexico admitting he finally feels hope
On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy and the two friends are happily reunited
And I truly mean that
When I first saw this film I was blown awayWith superb acting superb story perfect emotion and tone and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me this film is completely and utterly perfect
The film speaks of hope and the film s two main characters debate throughout the movie about it
One character believes that in prison hope is dangerous and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher
Another character believes that hope is needed because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight
While very engaging and immensely entertaining this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time in my opinion
If the ending is merely average this film would simply be considered good possibly great but not the masterpiece that it is today
And watching it repeatedly makes the film even better because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater
I ca nt speak for everybody but this is a film that I can watch over and over again and love it more each time I watch it
And while I simply talked about the ending this entire review that is not all that makes this film incredible
However I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is
And please do not waste any of your own time
Find a way to see this movie as ASAP
It will be time well spent and you will certainly see it multiple more times
I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time
I do nt necessarily think this movie was a but an easy for me
I am giving it a because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a just because others had given it a
As far I m concerned it s mine to give if I want to to give every a movie a LRB which by the way I do nt RRB
I am just sick of people telling me that a movie ca nt be great because it was story driven and not character driven maybe I like story driven movies I certainly liked this one
So here s another for you movie snobs will have to eradicate
The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of if not the perfect film
Every other great film or any film for that matter has it s pros and cons
Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it very few against it
While I feel there are films out there with better pros the pro to con ratio of The Shawshank Redemption outstands any other film film ever produced
I ca nt begin to describe every amazing element of this film
Obviously the performances are exquisite the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary
The cinematography in particular struck me
Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing
I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made
This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema
A very very very brilliant film
The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as always
The script was amazing along with the directing
The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is
And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart
It makes you care about criminals
The score is also very good
It s an enthralling piece of cinema and just Amazing
I d recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it
People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal just look at A Clockwork Orange
It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime
The cast and the story of the movie are really successful
Andy is a passionate character and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence
It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison
Oldfashioned prisons in the s are full of bad guy who do nt expect anything from the life
And they do nt think how we escape here
However Andy with his close friend in the prison Red tries redemption from this prison by the time Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention
It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison
But Andy approaches to place of exit
It is actually amazing it is really incredible
They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life
Also Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail
After the redemption they become free anymore
It is really an amazing movie
Easily one of the best movies made during the s and definitely one of the top prison movies of alltime
Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well
Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb s alltime best films ever
The casting is superb Morgan Freeman is Red a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who s made connections so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price he s under a life sentence for murder
Tim Robbins is Andy a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to life terms for killing his wife and her lover LRB which he like most other inmates say they re not guilty of RRB
And Bob Gunton is Warden Norton who when we first meet him is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline
While fortunately I ve had no first hand experience Shawshank certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society
A long movie most of it takes place inside a semicorrupt state penitentiary in the late s
Red in talking his thoughts out loud to himself becomes our narrator for many developments
As the story unfolds increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations
And in Andy s work for Warden Norton we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character all show and appearance and with no integrity substance
In Roger Ebert s first review LRB of his two RRB of this movie he said the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth despite everything the word redemption is in the title for a reason Most viewers will agree
The story begins with the trial of a young banker Andy Dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover
After a quick conviction Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison with no hope of parole
He exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him
His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from Ellis Redding
Ellis commonly referred to as Red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison
Andy s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him
Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle
By creating the film s firm foundation the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film s success
Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King s equally noteworthy novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
In this novella King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature
Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever
While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella Darabont also proves that a film s score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience as dialogue does
He employs the cunning Thomas Newman son of the legendary Hollywood composer Alfred Newman
Darabont shows recognition for the film s needs by employing Newman who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer as if a part of the scripted dialogue
Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition
His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed as his score received an Oscar nomination in
While unique and independent Newman s score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film
With work from vast array of talented scene designers costume designers composers cinematographers and various other Hollywood artists the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with
The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film
While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red respectively the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles
Most noticeable of these the veteran film star James Whitmore who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen
Brooks a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead
Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art and a focused purpose in their motivations creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable
httphowtogetridofacnequickorg From the summary above which you will have seen i stated the film to be a moving masterpiece
Right from the word go i was drawn into the films twisting emotional plot
It caught my attention that Frank Darabont has placed a small amount of aspects into the film that get the audience emotionally involved in which we base ourselves into simply putting our feet in one of the convicts shoes
Tt especially caught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks LRB James Whitmore RRB takes his own life the nondiagetic sound adding to the other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the tragic loss of the character in which we have been following through the course of the film
The cinematography throughout the film was basic and what i would term as standard seen before basic film camerawork
If this was better it would have highly improved the films overall watch
throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her lover
We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at Shawshank Prison
We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a nimble lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden
This all becomes of the fact that in Dufresne s previous life he was a city banker which is where he gets the nickname of wife murdering banker around the dim lit prison
Morgan Freeman also shows that he is one of the worlds leading role modelling actors as he pulls of another supreme unique perform
The way he acts during the duration of the film is entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and performs single handed an outstanding performance
The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters getting into difficult situation and how they overcome them or not
The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would term as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end
As suspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must watch
I generally do nt watch films more than once or twice but this is a different story
It still amazes me to this day and still gets me moving every time it also influences me a lot
The Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie
The movie depicts how a four lettered word Hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible
Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane LRB just amazing RRB and how he influences his fellow prisoner Red
The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of Red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across
This story proves that the king of horrors Stephen King is equally good at any other genre of Story Writing LRB Hats off RRB
The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring
The background score of the movie is excellent
Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively
I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again
A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely one of my all time favorites
A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE
HOPE One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live
We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving finding something that we dream of
In the words of this movie s protagonist hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies
Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman
This movie I m not going to call this film the IMDb movie but I really ca nt deny that this is fantastic
The cast the score the writing and the power are all here in this film and filled with strength
It s one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over
It is about a friendship a life an evil and a hope
A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls
We see these people as years of time goes by
We see friendships grow and topics change
It really puts you in the prison and makes you feel what s like to behind those bars
You feel the friendship the hope the darkness and the pure horror of it all
I never saw this film on the silver screen
I did nt want to see it on video either The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply
I m not watching a hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards
Fortunately for me this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made
This film received no hype nor the megabucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there
Because they did nt need to all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town
And so it proved I do nt care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story LRB a short story in this case RRB is top drawer
We have a man LRB Dufresne RRB who after being convicted wrongfully for murder uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive
Red LRB Freeman RRB the man who can get things befriends him
The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds
The Warden Samuel Norton is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo
Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act
Out of the three genredefining classics released in The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt
First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema s greatest watershed events Pulp Fiction
And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any thanks to the sweeping show by the critics darling Forrest Gump
But life ever since has been very kind to this film and both critics viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope friendship with remarkable amount of respect love kindness
Today The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that s arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in and while it was discarded at its time of release it is now rightly universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time
The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne a successful banker who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates prison staff including that of Red in whom Andy finds a trusted ally
The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades
Written directed by Frank Darabont this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope friendship redemption that ll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont s directional debut and he could nt have asked for a better start
All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment
Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth realism to the era this film is set in
Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light
Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy s life his friendship with Red and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded
And Thomas Newman s score beautifully blends with the film s tone characters lives and is emotionally fulfilling
Coming to the performances Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he did nt commit
And if Robbins is at his best then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red Andy s friend who is also serving a life sentence is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison
Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job
His work is grounded can go easily unnoticed but the character of Red is the soul of this story
There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people why many of them have latched on to it
There is a reason why even after two decades its legacy keeps flourishing viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value
One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks steel rods of a jailhouse
The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives institutions like work family society etc living up to the expectations of each one of them
On an overall scale The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life there are only two types of people one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom
The message it is trying to resonate is clear Fear can hold you prisoner Hope can set you free
And if we all give ourselves some hope there is nothing we ca nt survive
Yes it all seems preachy n everything but then if there s ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right it s The Shawshank Redemption
Strongly recommended
Moviemaking seems to be like golf for a truly excellent game ALL the elements must come together
Everyone involved must have perfect form
Director Darabont must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together
Of course the actors were excellent Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint
The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also
Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable LRB and bad guys do nt come much worse than them RRB
The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning middle and end
So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong
Not so with Shawshank Redemption
Just like Goldilocks said This is just right
Buy this one for your home collection because you ll definitely want to see it again
I have nt seen too many movies that I would rate a but I had no problems giving this one top score
I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn
And for generation after generation there s only one film that I will always give praise for finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought
A film called The Shawshank Redemption
Never has been before the film came out illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film
It s powerful in every way that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is a great story with great characters
Mainly about Andy Duferne LRB Tim Robbins RRB a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party who s a pro golfer
Duferne sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence
While counting his days inside several events happened to Andy
Meeting the sisters was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him which made his stay harder and longer than he thought
One day he also met Ellis Redding LRB Morgan Freeman RRB who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison as Andy asked him for a hammer
Unknown to Andy Redding had his bet on him earlier as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down
Subtlety the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years
The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay
They conversed things about the realities of prison
Which at times they contradicted at each other s opinion for Andy had always been the hopeful dreamer and Redding with his face of realism
The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money Andy through his skill will and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait
For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing that everyone should always have
The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages
Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom
It is substance over style at the end of the day
And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature
I totally adored the concept of hope in this film
I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers that s pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy
Now Morgan Freeman s got talent I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set
I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank
You know there s a lot more to say about this movie it s too good too be true
Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes the most moving scene
Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place
I m starting to regret not reading any of his novels
And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie
One of my favorite movies ever The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes placeBased on a Stephen King novel this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic filmTim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd Red Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despiseThis film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this factIt was nominated for seven Academy Awards including LRB Best Picture Best Actor Morgan Freeman Best Adapted Screenplay Best Cinematography Best Editing Best Original Score and Best Sound RRB but did nt win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest GumpI personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his careerBravo to this brilliant modern day classic
When i rented the movie i was doubtful whether to rent it or not
Then i started watching it
From the very st moment i was kinda sure it wud be worthy watching this and worthy it was
The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins the direction and everything puts you in the place of the actors making you feel the way they felt
This movie does nt have any dirty romance or impossible actions rather it focuses on a greater philosophy Hope to live when there is no hope survival This is one movie that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching
I wo nt say anymore the rest is upto you to find out when you see the movie At the time of writing this comment IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No in top best movies of all time
Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb s strict rating criteria
Shawshank is indeed up there amongst the best and if you have nt seen it yet you should make it a point to watch it at least once sometime in your life
For it is an astonishing tale of endurance courage life and perspective combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry
No words can explain how good Shawshank really is but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness
To be honest I enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film
You usually get far more character development than in a movie LRB eg Puzo s The Godfather RRB
But not with Shawshank
This is the closest thing film has to a perfect story
The characters pacing plot monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending
Brook s suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears and if you watch just one film in your life let it be this
Not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office eg LOTR The Return of the King The Godfather but an original standalone film that in my opinion will never be surpassed in quality This is one of the best movies ever made
Not really because it s really really good but because everyone likes it
I ca nt think of anyone who does nt like this movies young old male female and over the entire globe
Good Work
It s a story about a man LRB Tim Burton RRB who is cent to jail for a crime he did nt commit LRB the murder of his wife and lover RRB
In jail he meets good and bad people like always
One of them is Morgan Freeman
He is the guy who can get you anything you want
Because Tim Burton is innocent and a very intelligent guy he is desperately trying to find a way out of this jail
The relationship between Tim Burton and the rest of his jailmates can be touching but also horrible and with some violence
This is a great feelgood movie about hope love hate and freedom
When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like
After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton
Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time
At the end it made me cry and thought about life
Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye
Fantastic film and worth watching it s really realistic film and another one of stephen king s great stories a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing if you have nt seen this film already then watch it it is brilliant just brilliant
This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen
Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work
The direction of it is exquisite LRB and gives much to Tim Robbins character I know he is a good actor but the direction gives so much more to him RRB
The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite LRB thanks to Stephen King RRB
I have seen many greats Citizen Kane The Godfather Cuckoo s Nest The Deer Hunter Apocalypse Now etc
This movie is fantastic and the fact it didnt win LRB or even get nominated RRB for an Oscar is the reason I do nt pay attention to the Oscars anymore
This movie is fantastic and an artistic triumph
I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick
People look for all sorts of things in movies and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie
Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen
Others are action junkies
Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot or the niftiest angle
For all of these there is the very real chance that they simply will not get this film and that s too bad they are missing out on a classic
At its best film can transcend merely being a series of pictures no matter how pretty and can reach down and touch people
That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly
It is not the fastest moving movie not the edgiest not the grittiest it is filmed in shades of gray
But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done
And THAT is filmmaking at its finest
Not a game not eye candy this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled
It deserves ten stars
Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit although some may not have the patience for the slowness
But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm emotionbuilding pace such as this
Otherwise one would never get to know Tim Robbins s quiet accountant LRB and what makes him appear alternately shy snobbish and suicidal all at the same time RRB or Morgan Freeman s genialbutcynical lifer not to mention how he s a man who knows how to get things
I love what the film does nt do it does nt make an issue of its two leads being different races LRB although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous RRB it does nt pull any sensational farout action punches LRB as films with an allmale cast often do RRB and it does nt freeze its characters into types
Everyone is real and everyone is flawed from James Whitmore s bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton s pretentious icy warden
But the finish LRB which really starts around the film s last twenty minutes RRB is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film
Get it in either format
Most of the people here is the best movie in the world to join me
Watching very very impressed
What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway
Acting on cues can say is enormous
There s no posturing
Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone s lips
Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into
Finals if he so exhilarating you a highquality music
And finding that deserves really deserve
I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way
This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars
Will remain as the best film in more than years I believe wholeheartedly sites
Definitely my best movie
A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is
Greatest movie ever made
Get real
It s not even the greatest prison movie ever made
Hell it s not even the best movie released in
It s predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clich s It s also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe
Still it s an entertaining movie
Nice direction from Frank Darabont
Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast
Tim Robbins however is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly staresoffintothedistance moments
He s so far beneath Freeman as an actor it s sad
With a normal movie like this I would focus more on the positives
I did give it a after all
Unfortunately it is easily the most overrated movie of all time LRB on IMDb for sure RRB and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack
Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a out of because they feel it should be lower then a and go on to write what they really think to you people I write this you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be ie if you think the movie deserves an out of then you should vote as such I think this movie deserves a out of and so I have given it as such
As for the movie I ca nt tell you how incredible it is in my opinion it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again and not get tired of watching it the cast was spot on everything was perfect the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley all of it was simply spot on honestly speaking I do nt know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is well deserving of its number spot on IMDb Also I read that people do nt understand how Andy pinned the pictures to his wall it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of how he put the poster back up after entering the hole because the poster never gets taken down
This suspense filled dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery self worth and self preservation if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself
There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie Morgan Freeman
Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie Darabont s screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none
The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary
At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate Ellis Boyd Red Redding LRB Morgan Freeman RRB Red was a contraband smuggler
Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation
The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book the movie has numerous cast and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end
It did nt do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost but due to critic s high rating and Academy Award nomination Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations the movie did well in rental and DVD sales it is shown regularly on Cable TV and it has a high following
Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King s books He directed the Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this
The Green Mile is another of King s books that is about a prison and Darabont also directed the movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book
awesome movie the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb one of my favorite movies
I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it
this is one movie that took over my mind for many days
It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie s can be made in this way alsoso I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this filmhatsoff to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a centurylets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film
I ve heard of this movie before i saw it to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue man
when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the st top movie in the American cinema s history I d like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it i give it up for their great effort that will last in every one s memory for his life time
I m sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me I did my best to deliver what i think
Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail
Superb
Great
Masterpiece
Unforgettable
Excellent
Brilliant
No no no
I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film
Nothing s found yet and to be honest I think nothing will be found forever
The movie ca nt be expressed by words
Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece
But I m hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies When it come to the Shawshank Redemption I prefer to remain silent because silence is full of unspoken words I will never forget the first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption with my father
Both of us were fans of prison and malebonding movies and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama
Needless to say that when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts and before the second viewing we would regularly mention how great that film with the poster was
Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV and after each viewing it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal
I guess if it does nt justify at least it explains why this movie that did nt do well in the theaters had a better success on VHS TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone The Godfather from the first place on IMDb Top
And it s only justice if The Shawshank Redemption the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious made by a relatively unknown director a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well as if it applied its own philosophy patiently but determinedly
This is the strength of The Shawshank Redemption its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the socalled essential the simplest things take their full meanings the smallest details have their share of importance
And think about it in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits where the days are regulated by the same routine all you can do is to make a life out of this routine make a place to get closer to your own definition of having a life
And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank from the first vertiginous panoramic shot we re literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location conveying a very hostile feel
These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton who s like the male alterego of Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest
And the comparison with Forman s film is nt fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure time by getting busy finding their own reasontobe like the veteran Brooks LRB James Whitmore RRB was the man with the books Red remarkably played by Morgan Freeman was the man who could get you things
In a very intelligent move from the script the hero of the film the laconic Andy Dufresne an upperclass banker played in all nuance by Tim Robbins is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover
And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character
I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend
Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and busy in the same time
And again their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker s casket again and feels that prison did nt deprive him from his social quality
Shawshank is not slow but more a patiencedemanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence
And the film s motto on which relies its philosophical core is Get busy living or get busy dying
Now two things occur to me while writing these lines a heartbreaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after years of detention and who realized he was institutionalized
A notion explained by Red when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside it s all dark and your time is deconstructed
Brooks could nt live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live
The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today
And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech I could nt help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont s film an invitation to dream to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom this is the triumph of human spirit this understanding of the value of life is The Shawshank Redemption In the same vein than One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest Shawshank is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best for whatever constitutes our dreams being men again able to enjoy to feel to give a meaning to our lives
In other words hope hope that things can get better despite the adversity
To quote Steve Jobs Courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose
This is the true intelligence of life what makes it worth living
I have grown up watching Bollywood movies full of overacting by overpaid overfed heroes
It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot
This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison
It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence
Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons
The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman s brilliant narration offering a secondperson view of life in shawshank
But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced wealthy bankerThe last forty minutes of this film however help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces
You do nt need a weapon to fight
It is easy to take away a man s bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope
What to say about the Shawshank Redemption
I should nt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is
This movie is freakin immaculate
Darabont and Co have created not only the most inspiring film in ages but one of the most emotionally significant films to date
The movie teaches things to us that we need to know messages on hope perseverance and friendship and it does it with marvelous eloquency
All in all The Shawshank Redemption remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen a master piece of art
Perfect
I felt a sudden need to create an account on the web
Why
I do not know
Having never written any movie review I sometime wonder why I felt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so
But then I ask myself Do there really have to be a purpose
Maybe not
The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago
I had looked up the evening s TV program and I stumbled across the movie title
Not really expecting anything out from the film s summary I sat down on this evening and watched it
And did it move me
I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained The acting the environment the music and the story
The ladder plays an important role in the movie
Why
Because in short the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder and the next many years in which he spends inside prison
But there is something more to it
The story is so well polished constructed and so well told that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie which could have made it so moving and so hearttouching
Because really it is all the details and the finesse of the movie which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling
Throughout the minutes of the film you will be witness to fantastic all around acting particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller
With the film starting out slowly it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film where the film really starts to touch your soul
The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made I dare say that
I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film but there is simply too much
In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen
My advice is Buy the film and watch it you will not be disappointed
The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons
The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job and that is saying something
Freeman is the greatest actor of all time
Secondly Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand
The supporting actors are wonderful as well
Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling
The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed in the end its just a feel good story
I can not express this enough GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW
It is awesome and will never be topped
I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it
Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors
And this must be his best roll ever
I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film
All the prison guards and inmates were really believable
The story captures you from the beginning and does nt let go until the final credits are rolled
This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about
Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation
And that nothing is black and white
But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind
This film is love it or hate it flawless
I find myself unable to pick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or inconsistent
The Director Frank Darabont despite his muchlessthanimpressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail
Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplay
Originally published under Richard Bachman Stephen King s once pseudonym Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history
The book makes no attempt to build or define characters background or story progression
It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book as hopeless as a man s situation is his dreams and fantasies live on
After King s catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages later
Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe
Credit where credit s due Stephen King does nt even deserve royalties
For it s subtlety it s intelligence and it s gorgeous cinematography LRB often overlooked in this film RRB this is one of the finest films ever made
Robbins and Freeman are brilliant
The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless
The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a fulllength film by Frank Darabont
A powerful story of one man s journey through a punishment he did not deserve and redemption of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers
It reminds us that hope is a good thing maybe the best of things
Gentle and supremely smart
Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful haunting tragic yet slightly comical films in creation
This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History
Complete with an amazing cast a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing this film is truly incredible
The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison
Andy soon befriends a man named Red a man imprisoned for murder and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison
Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker and an unlikely friendship emerges and soon Prison life does nt seem so bleak for Andy
As Andy s journey through his life sentence grows so does his friendship with Red and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events
Andy s personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people fundamentally without knowing how as he spreads new lessons both comically and psychologically and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first
As time goes on Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards
But as he continues to work hard for the good of others he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are
Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be and Andy s life takes a serious turn and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy s decisions become more and more unpredictable
Based on a short book by Stephen King this film has hardly any faults at all and is full of beauty tragedy and comedy and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy
But what makes this film go down in history is nt just the amazing script and the wonderful acting but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known written by Thomas Newman
Many of the tunes are simplistic yet very memorable and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in
This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected
This film is a true classic
This is a work of art which is endlessly reexperiencable with painful pleasure
After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was
It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it
What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story which again was very good
How anyone can say it less must not have been watching it properly
There is nothing to say to criticise the movie the acting was brilliant the casting great and the directing breath taking
But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life Steven King
Without having writers like him we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather
I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top list however i am doubtful if this will ever happen
I saw LRB once again RRB last night Shawshank Redemption
If I have seen it once I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me
Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time Shawshank is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life love and prison to remain the true person he always was
Andy although a solitary and enigmatic person finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse
In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope
Red is one of those humans
Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current human existence
I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival
This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it
Sure I had nt just picked a movie at random at the local DVDshop but I did nt expect it to be so good
After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number on the top movies list
I wondered to myself why did nt I know about this movie
Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite wellknown actors
Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in when the Green Mile was released
Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television because it surely is nt on television often enough or it could just be me not knowing very much about the filmworld before
For in fact everyone in my school seemed to have known the Shawshank Redemption for a very long time
One of the best movies ever my best friend said My favorite movie in the whole wide world another one of my friends
THEN WHY DID NT YOU TELL ME I replied
If you liked the Green Mile I m telling you now you ll love this
I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course
The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language powerful and powerless speech posture intimate and social distances territory chronemics various types of listening and self disclosure
Many young students struggle to relate inclassintext examples to their own lives and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication
ALWAYS a good experience for my students
this film is an award winning achievement i loved it what a fantastic and brilliant together drama and crime movie really really amazing a must see to everyonethe story is about a guy called Andy Dufresne who was sent to prison for a murder that was committed to his wife and Andy goes through prison with hard times and a friend for his time in the shaw shank prison with brilliant ac tining from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and Clancy brown throughout the film Tim Robbins was Andy Morgan freeman red and Clancy brown as the guardoverall the whole truth can not be told u will love this film do nt spoil this for your self its a brilliant story with friendship and survival you must get this on DVD trust me its brilliant I feel sorry for all of you guysgirls who rated this as star LRB awful RRB
I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen
Maybe it is overrated maybe not but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top
This is supposed to be a USER RATING so if you loved it give it a if for you it is an average movie give it a
I read some comments about this one and heard someone saying it is a good movie deserves or stars but i gave it star because I think it is very overrated That s so pathetic Shawshank Redemption First time when I heard this name I had no idea what Shawshank is all about
I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie
This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life
That s the power of this movie
I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others
Story goes this way A man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover
He got two life sentences back to back
He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this
The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie
So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the Shawshank
This is one of those films that come once in a blue moon
The ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film Although Shawshank does take a while to get started but you understand why later on the film
The characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film
What really makes this film great is the use of no special effects no stunts just plain simple amazingly original witty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones
Just based in a prison men talking to each other
This film does make you feel involved in the film
You feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness
When the film ends it takes you seconds to get back to reality again its just that compelling This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it
This story is about a respectable banker LRB Andy Duframe RRB who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit
Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life
However Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison
At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made
A must watch film
It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it
Adapted from a Steven King short story LRB usually a sure sign of success RRB yet a disappointment at the box office
Nominated for seven Oscars yet emerging with no wins
But hope sprung eternal and as life began to imitate art like its central characters the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time
Directorscreenwriter Frank Darabont working from Steven King s short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion
Darabont s script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity
Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank s without coming across as painfully clich d but Darabont s airtight script chock full of timeless lines and steady careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled
From Roger Deakins sweeping operatic cinematography to Thomas Newman s truly beautiful and inspiring musical score to the dank gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself the film s consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning
It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material but Darabont s incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless
Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life never without a passionate twinkle in his eye even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes
Rather than typical leading man grandstanding Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result
The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate Red resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character with Freeman building a career of playing similar wise mentor figures off his performance
The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role
Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hateinspiring prison warden infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture
Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards
Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks Overall The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental but never sappy larger than life but never melodramatic
In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work screen writing and acting
Far from being a simple prison drama the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion
While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing it s Darabont s fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free
The Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene
Although Andy s innocence was obvious from the beginning you just think how he s going to get out of it
For me the power and depth in this movie was it s ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside
Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in
I m not sure why this affected me so much but i think it s just the fact that one mistake forced these people to live in a certain way where they do nt want so much freedom and they re used to being workers with no rewards
They just could nt adapt to the outside world
As if it were a different planet or something
Although the men are supposed to be cold hearted killers they seem so nice and are so easy to sympathise with
I know it sounds lame to feel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and acting had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent except for some obviously
Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i just wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the movie
If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first time they ve seen it i think it s a sign that if the person reading this still has nt they should
The Shawshank Redemption most definitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top
Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King comes the incredible prison story called The Shawshank Redemption
It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover
Sent to the notorious Shawshank Dufresne is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces
During the ensuing years however he is further subjected to additional punishment by the Sisters who enjoy torturing what they call fresh fish
Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can
Being extremely agile at his banking craft he overhears Captain Byron T Hadley LRB Clancy Brown RRB complain of his personal financial problems
This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again
Over the years he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis Red Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor Morgan Freeman
When warden Samuel Norton LRB Bob Gunton RRB learns of Dufresnes financial ability he immediately takes advantage of it
This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner
Both can benefit from the outcome
The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to
Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects
With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood Gil Bellows as Tommy Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience
I have never commented on a film but living as movie lover a great movie lover I ve always been seeking for finest fine movies movies that ca nt be forgotten that would give a meaning to me The Shawshank Redemption it is a movie that I ca nt say anything about it else than powerful wellmade and meaningful to me as God as my witness to this moment I have nt seen any movie better than that It was recommended by a dear friend of mine but I never took seriously until I watched the first thirty minutes of it then I regretted that I ve never attempted to watch it before that moment Hope something good never dies I have hope that I believe in and I believe that someday that hope will get me through life The Shawshank Redemption gives hope and that s enough for a movie I do nt have that great knowledge of movie but I do believe that this is one of the finest movies that were ever made This is the
Absolute must see film of the s Our Generation anyone s lifetime and quite possibly the history of film
Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster
Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise you ll wish to share it with everyone you know
Do nt think another Prison Movie aboutthis one it s above and beyond that clich
Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins Bob Gunton and James Whitmore
Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast
I Can not emphasizethe importance of this film
I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece
It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day
thank you
in my opinion it s better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale so this time the escape is greater
and the hero is an ordinary man who is so patient and hopeful while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that it s social or silly story but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong it s a Brilliant Story a never seen before a very powerful drama
the best thing in that movie was the relations between characters like hating and true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman The Count of Monte Cristo is nt a very good book and has spawned a few pretty poor films but it s the ideas which make it an enduring story
Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas s LRB Dumass s RRB book when writing the original short story I do nt know what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour typically coarselydetailed potboiler and evolved it into something special
The big step for me was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing
I do nt think there s a dull line of dialogue in the movie and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted
Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars LRB like Braveheart did in the year Shawshank Redemption was nominated RRB I ll truly never fathom
Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent wait ten years then take a vote that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what s left is worth remembering
In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it
It s probably my favorite movie
It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but the first time you watch it when you do nt know what is about to happen is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies
I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time
As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit
I am not going to talk about the ending and for god s sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them
This is the best movie robbed of acclaim
I do nt care what anyone says about Forest Gump
This movie is better in almost every category except music and maybe tied for movie of the yearTim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks
I always have a problem with the simpleton character getting acting nods as with the white trash and ghetto thug characters
I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel LRB Simpsons RRB I ca nt quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie but this movie blows me away on almost every level
The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick character
This movie is good there s no question about that but he nd best ever
That s a bit of a stretch
I ca nt really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the and votes have seen very many other good movies
Sure the story is meaningful and it s harsh etc but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful
The fact that Shawshank is on this list is a reflection of those voting
The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family
Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime
I have seen tons of films
Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyone s heart
From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made
My favorite movie ever
These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie
A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie but this is very entertaining
Tim Robbins LRB The Player IQ RRB stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover
He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison s head convicts wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman LRB Driving Miss Daisy Seven RRB
In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club he s convicted of putting eight bullets in them four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison
Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison systemIt does nt sound like a great movie but trust me this is the best movie I ve ever seen and everyone I know liked it
Tim Robbins is great in the lead
Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden
William Sadler LRB Solo Die Hard RRB is solid as a fellow convict
Clancy Brown LRB Starship Troopers Highlander RRB is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards
Finally James Whitmore LRB The Relic RRB and Gil Bellows LRB Snow White A tale of terror RRB give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts
A must see
None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption
But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there s a whole new reality within those walls
He may be a con but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he s made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison
At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship
In the end they beat the system in a most unique way
There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies
Two I ve already mentioned
My favorite prison film is Robert Redford s Brubaker but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close
As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont
Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor
The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in
A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for years and paroled and just ca nt make it on the outside
He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden
Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption
You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton
This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts
At the same time he s raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins
The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story
But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film
I have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now the second time being about a week ago
After the first time I saw it I gave it a perfect rating on IMDb something I do very rarely LRB I ve given out ratings of out of the movies I ve rated RRB
However after just one viewing I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list
After a second viewing I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it
The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on
The movie runs about minutes long but it never gets boring
While it is admittedly slow paced this only serves into its greatness
It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them along the way we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank
The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next never feeling forced or losing your interest
The movie is mostly dialogue driven but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life
Finally the final minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie
I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it but suffice to say the final act of the movie leaves you floored
Both times that I saw it I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole
Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies highly entertaining
I particularly love Pulp Fiction however it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture
It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion arguably the best film of the decade and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made
The even bigger tragedy though is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance Tim Robbins turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination
Robbins carries the film and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen
The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie
It takes you in from the opening scene and does nt let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close
Along the way it will make you think fear wonder and feel a number of other emotions
If you have not seen this movie waste no time go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb
This is a good movie and surely is right up there among the finest prisonconcentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality
In my mind I compare this genre to submarine films confined space lots of guys under constant threat therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat LRB ha ha RRB
But also with obvious problems in providing something new
The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows despotic warden sadistic guards evil fellow inmates who want to killrape you but also few trusted friends LRB along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending RRB and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something notsobad crime
So what s so special here
come on Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King s hitpenitentiarydrama The Green Mile ie manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters
Or maybe the majority of moviegoers consider what they re watching at face value and never mind that I ve seen this all before feel
Or maybe they have nt or just have a lousy memory
Yes I admit I m something of a cynic
But I also believe I m able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one
Probably that s the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all Mervyn LeRoy s I m A Fugitive From A Chain Gang as the alltime best prisonflick
No film snobbery here as I hope you ll agree when you see this true classic
After watching the shawshank redemption it left me with a true feeling of hope
The whole film symbolises the idea that hope can get through any challenge
I heard of this movie in the same way many other people did through a recommendation from a friend describing it as the best movie he had ever seen
Even though I watched it with high expectations I was not at all disappointed
If I could recommend anything from this comment it would be to watch this movie
Its in the top for a reason
The story the film revolves around and the relationship between Red and Andy is truly amazing to watch but also is the way that each time I watch the film I uncover new depth to it and new angles from which to view the movie
There are many hidden references and ideas that can be taken from the Shawshank redemption making it a movie that works on many levels LRB this being a rarity for most modern blockbusters RRB
The greatest movie ever made
Period
Pure and simple it is what every director hope to achieve
The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it meansIt will bring tears to your eyes
It will make you think how you have lived your life so far or in fact how you have wasted it
It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought
And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely
The performances are simply mind boggling be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others
And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a directorIf you have nt already seen it please do otherwise you are missing something
Okay let s say this from the word go Shawshank Redmeption might as well be called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz
Lets just see how many shopworn prison movie cliches the picture has RRB
A corrupt warden RRB
Brutal guards RRB
Homosexual gang attacks LRB at least not in a shower RRB RRB
Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery RRB
All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty phrases
RRB
No racial tension in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan Freeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple picture after all it appears all he is there for is to be the witty sidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad women
RRB
A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison RRB
Nobody in jail is bad or even seems like they could be violent they are all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs
I guess this means we should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just like us a chilling thought
RRB
Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to escape RRB
Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself clean of his past and putting on a new life
I am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared Straight but come on this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very unreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say
The Shawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another holier than thou morality play packaged as gritty realism all because it is based in a prisonhohum
Sorry folks but can this film really be LRB one of RRB the greatest of all time
Entertaining
Yes
Well acted
Err yes
Life affirming
No way
Realistic
Do nt make me laugh
Twenty years or so pass in this film
Does anybody get any older
Apart from the occasional pair of specs that s it
Not an extra wrinkle to be seen
What happened to the makeup department
People get beaten to within an inch of their lives
One death and one wheelchair case but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear rapidly The baddies get their just deserts and we re all supposed to shout serve them right LRB as we say in England RRB
The goodies live happily ever after but we knew that would happen within the first ten minutes
The people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a great author
Competent and popular yes
Great no
PS
Who replaced the poster after
Was that an oak tree
Maybe leaves are a different shape in America The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence
Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound
And he was nt
This is a film about a prisoner who well I ca nt give away the plot for it s much better to come to the screen in ignorance but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy finds out the truth about himself or is in any way redeemed is grasping at straws
These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them
I have a theory so many people have told Darabont that The Shawshank Redemption was a profound lifechanging experience that he believed them and then SET OUT to make another profound life changing experience with The Green Mile with predictably ghastly results
I have nt seen The Green Mile yet so I ca nt be sure
Do nt get me wrong
A great movie need nt be profound and the film which I think is the best ever made is nt profound either it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind
Still The Shawshank Redemption is nt even great
It s a very good story very well told
Lucky we get such nice photography rather than having to put up with Stephen King s prose every step of the way Also Tim Robbins has the lead role
LRB Lucky again that it was nt Tom Hanks now THERE S a frightening thought RRB
Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can
Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie but I do nt think it makes such extravagant claims about itself which is why it works so well
By far Shawshank was the best film of
But look who it was up against at the Oscars Forrest Gump
It s not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be in fact it was good
But it was also a very hyped movie
The public ate it up and they also got too much of it
That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so
But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry
I wish the Oscar s did nt do this all the time
They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes
It was robbed
But that does nt make it any less of a film
It s a triumph of filmmaking
Robbins and Freeman are excellent
The character Brooks is terrific and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton
Go rent this movie if it s the last thing you do
The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history
Truly a masterpiece of cinema
I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by
Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film
How did it not win oscars galore
Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story
A love of hope a love of friendship and a love of life no matter the constraints
I LOVE THIS FILM
Emotion hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film
Quite simply no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay casting and plot development
No spoilers here just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings
Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime
Everything else comes together in perfect harmony
This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the cake
Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again
This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama suspense and flow
If you have nt seen this film please do yourself the favour and watch it
I know you will not be disappointed
Let me tell you a little story
I am years old and consider myself an avid movie buff
From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindler s List to The Matrix I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies
After being desensitized by the poor gorefest known as Hostel I came home and watched this movie with some friends
Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up
I do nt do it often and I certainly was nt expecting to tonight
But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul
It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time
Please go see this in its entirety if you have not
Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as out of
I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie and loved it but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story
Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say OMG I love this story
Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I m totally freaking insane for at least one more day But I digress
The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine a man convicted of murdering his wife
He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison
Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank
Highly educated quiet and philosophical Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman and quickly becomes one of their own
Without giving too much away the movie follows Andy s life in prison as narrated by Freeman as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both
Andy learns for example to bargain with what he has LRB ie his financial knowledge RRB for what he needs
Initially many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense
The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human
It is about loss regret perseverance friendship and ultimately faith
How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life
How do we recover when life beats us down
And how can we seek strength in our connections to others
These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at
It is alternately funny tragic violent and inspirational
Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made
Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen
Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made and definitely the best film of
Yes it is better than Lion King and I really like that too
It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too
I will confess that I did nt understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film and I have now seen it three times
I seriously hope that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film as it really is
The dialogue was extremely well written with lines that really stick in your mind
The cinematography and music are both gorgeous and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film
In the script there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan and usually do nt like coarse language in books
But in his books like It which is very good I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors LRB like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning RRB
The acting was exceptional
I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins but he did a great job in a very demanding role
The best performance however comes from Morgan Freeman as Red who was seriously robbed of that Oscar that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump
Freeman reminds me very strongly or his style of acting does remind me of that of Sean Connery suave yet very charismatic
Acting is nt just about your vocal range it s about depth which was what Freeman certainly had
In short Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance
The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment and I actually cried in Brook s death scene
Very rarely do King adaptations translateto screen well because of the large scale of the author s books with the exception of this and the Shining
Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding
And some like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable
In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for solong
of course
Bethany Cox
In this review I m not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I m sure everybody else who has commented on it has
However I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it
The acting is uncommonly magnificent
Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned lifeserving prisoner Ellis Boyd Red Redding Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy the central character James Whitmore s portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton and Clancy Brown s commanding performance as Captain Hadley the sadistic head prison guard almost makes him steal the show from Freeman
Frank Darabont s restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clich d and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air
On account of Darabont the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film
Perfect emotional movie for all ends reality of human behaviors Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency
The door bursts open
A MAN and WOMAN enter drunk and giggling horny as hell
No sooner is the door shut than they re all over each other ripping at clothes pawing at flesh mouths locked togetherHe gropes for a lamp tries to turn it on knocks it over instead
Hell with it
He s got more urgent things to do like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts
She arches moaning fumbling with his fly
He slams her against the wall ripping her skirt
We hear fabric tear
He enters her right then and there roughly up against the wall
She cries out hitting her head against the wall but not caring grinding against him clawing his back shivering with the sensations running through her
He carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him
They fall onto the bedOne of the fantastic I ever watched
there are no words to praise this movies
everyone should watch this movieI am so impressed with Morgan Freeman in this movie
He just gave life to this movie
He proved himself one of the best actor on the planet earthThe story is very different
I was so thrilled as i finished watching the movie
I was stunned with the ending
A great ending to the movie
I added this movie to may favorite movie list
If anyone interested in Hollywood movies then he should watch this movieI have no words to explain this movie because this is so much great movie that no one can explain or criticize itThe movie The Shawshank Redemption which came out in is about two main characters Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB and Ellis Boyd Red Redding LRB Morgan Freeman RRB and their journey through prison in the s
Andy was falsely accused and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover
This movie represents integrity as Andy never gives up and he knows that in the end he will be free as he was falsely accused
He knew that one day the prison guards and warden would pay their dues for how they ran their prison
This movie shows it all and is absolutely a out of
My favorite scene was when Andy was when Andy gets access to the room where the microphone is set up to talk over the intercom
Andy plays a record of two ladies singing and all of the prisoners sit in awe not knowing what to think or how to feel
Red makes the statement that he does nt know what the two ladies were singing let alone saying but how it brought peace over his mind and the others as the music was calming soothing and a sight of the real world
This is a movie that you can watch it again right after you just finished watching it
There is so much anticipation and as a viewer you get wrapped up in the scene and the emotions that are the prisoners are feeling
Another scene that really made me nervous was when Red is about to leave to meet Andy in Buxton County and he signs his name on the board where a previous prison member hung himself and had signed his name before he committed suicide
In this scene the viewers watches Red sign his name and assume that he is going to hang himself but the scene flashes forward to Red digging up a box that Andy had given him directions to
In that box there is cash and a post car of where Andy is at
This film is absolutely amazing and I recommend it to anyone
I could go on forever about this movie but it is a must see it s a movie that will have you thinking about it after you watch it
The friendship that Andy and Red made was unbreakable they had hope in one another
Each character showed determination and courage this is a movie that you wont regret watching
On the other hand a children s movie that shows integrity would be the movie Antz
As adults watch Shawshank they can relate on multiple levels as they have gone through life experiences where they have been falsely accused or have been in a situation where they know if they stay true to themselves then the right thing will happen
Same goes for children in the movie Antz as Flick never gives up on himself or the fact that he is trying to help his colony even when they are all against himtruly one of the best movie i have ever seen the acting of Morgan freeman is outstanding as it always is also Tim Robbins has done nice work the plot of the movie is very enjoying and wo nt let you get sleepy
the movie is very much interesting at all times and most of the time you cant predict what s going to happen also the cast of the movie is very appropriatewhen i watched the movie i was truly amazed by the story and no matter its the best movie of all time also the direction of Frank Darabont is really worth appreciating as his direction made the movie really awesome the movie again is truly worth watching i enjoyed watching this movie and hope you guys enjoy it too Outstanding film i have ever seen

However you ca nt beat films like this and I have to admit LRB cue clich RRB they just do nt make films like this anymoreThis is my favourite film and I would recommend this to anyone who has not seen it yet to put it top of their watchlistThe story begins with the trial of a young banker Andy Dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover
After a quick conviction Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison with no hope of parole
He exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him
His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from Ellis Redding
Ellis commonly referred to as Red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison
Andy s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him
Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyleYes it s a fantastic movie
It does hit a huge range of genres and does deserve a high placement
However it was so talked up as the perfect movie that it did lead to a disappointment the first time round
I did thoroughly enjoy it but it is nt a movie that can be enjoyed and experienced in any mood or situation
It s a fantastic movie but here s a list of moods that this movie will NOT work in Absolute chill Innocent Brain dead Crazy hypo And if you re already feeling down maybe find something else to pick you up
Definitely give it a go and see why it s so high and you will enjoy it if you sit back relax and engage in the storyShawshank Redemption Review The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant dramatic film directed and written by Frank Darabont
This film which includes main characters Andy LRB Tim Robbins RRB and Red LRB Morgan Freeman RRB make this movie and instant classic
Andy finds himself in prison with Red who each comes from two complete different backgrounds
Andy and Red end up end the same position but both have one mind in goal and that is to get busy living or get busy dying
This incredible story of friendship and loyalty shows that even in the worst of times you can still make the best of the situation
Andy dreams of living outside of prison and Red gives Andy a reality check many times over while serving their long prison sentences to remind Andy that they are going to die in the prison
Andy is a sly and smart and Red knows and likes this about Andy
Andy feels like he can only trust Red in prison and shows that if they ever get out of prison they will meet up and be together on the outside
Andy learns that the chief guard played by Clancy Brown needs tax help which before prison was Andy s specialty
This propels Andy to take charge of all financial duties for the prison assigned by the Warden
Little secret be known that this eventually helps Andy escape from the prison
This American classic shows how Andy demises his escape from the prison while using the prison as a bank account for himself
Meanwhile Andy s best friend Red finds himself up for parole many times over the years and gets rejected every time
Red goes up for parole after being in prison for years and finds himself on the outside finding it a whole new world than when he had come into prison
Life being hard to deal with Red goes to the place that Andy wanted to meet
Here he finds a large amount of money and makes a trip to a place called Zihuatanejo Mexico that Andy talked about while in Prison
Finally these two meet up and live the life that Andy had dreamed about
Shawshank is a heartwarming movie classic which shows that you can be happy in bad times and dreams do come true
This American movie classic reminds you of films such as the Green Mile
Each part of this movie moves you and the editing of this film makes this movie seem flawless with incredible music to enhance each character s roleIt turned my thought that how to achieve the goal with Patient
I am really amazed
There is no confusion that theme of this story is nice
I like to watch straggling life
It makes me determined to do anything in this world
And I started to think everything is possible here nothing impossible
But when he went to bank I was afraid
What s going to happen
Finally He broke the security and got the plan which he made
I think noting bad here when he is a victim
There is no way for him to do
So It s was a perfect attack in the root of corruption
If most of the victims in this world follow this way with Patient I think it will be possible to make a little change
Although it s not so easy to find similar minded human
The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that I wished I d seen on the big screen
Thanks to videos however all was not lost
Whether intentional or not this film is about grace and hope as well as the redemption that can occur even in the most dark and degrading corners of our world
Conceived and produced by the secular film community this engrossing film stands as one of the most entertaining thoughtprovoking dramas of this centuryBut it s a film for mature audiences
It takes us to a setting that s disturbing uses language that s raw showcases supporting characters who are far from ideal role models and reforms not one villain by the ending credits
It deals with sex and violence but never in a prurient way
There are numerous brutal occasionally fatal beatings
No scene is foisted onto us to incite our own lust or rage but clearly shows this type of action as harmful and wrong
The movie s theme is redemption from a hellish place it could nt have been made without these elements
I highly recommend watching it with an older teenager and discussing it together in the light of many of the points I bring up in this reviewThe hero Andy Dufresne is wrongly accused of killing his wife and receives two life sentences
Steadily and quietly in prison he wards off the bitterness against that injustice and the further hardships he suffers by doing good for others even those that despise him
The narrator is Red a hardened and resourceful inmate who repeatedly warns his friends that Hope is a dangerous thing
The prison warden is a hypocritical fanatic who uses the Lord the Bible and the people for his own scheming murdering purposes
Do nt let this characterization turn you off
It s not the hackneyed Hollywood cheapshot believers have come to expect
To make this moving allegory work it s a necessary depiction
In the bestseller of all time a blameless Hero s chief antagonist was the conservative religious coalition of the day that carried out a sinister plot in order to maintain its own political power
The picture is a truthful thoughtful warning for Christian America today and should nt be dismissed out of handIn fact there are many similarities between the heroes of The Shawshank Redemption and The Gospel
The central characters are both wrongly accused
One receives two life sentences and the other is crucified
Neither are readily esteemed by their contemporaries
Andy s a banker how can the average indebteduptotheirneck consumer sympathize with that
Jesus is a Nazarene how can any good thing come from Nazareth
LRB John RRB
While Andy is certainly flawed the good work he does while in prison actually serves a ruthless political end that ends up holding him captive
Jesus was ridiculed and executed by the same people He came to freeWhile the characters are believable and the script excellent the cinematography provides the important view in the film
Thick walls imposing fences and confined spaces remind us of the oppression
The guards relentless marching and the heavy bars slamming open and slamming shut reinforce it
Dull chipped walls in every room surround the dulled chipped lives of utterly hopeless men
But the camera does nt linger too long in this kind of darknessHope is scattered throughout this excellent film
Italian opera broadcast over loudspeakers and senate appropriations for library books
An ice cold one down your throat and the thought of a place of no memory LRB Hebrews RRB
High school equivalence exams and a harmonica
Alexander Dumas and Rita HaworthHope triumphs gloriously in the end
It only takes years
Andy escapes the hard way and makes it possible for his friend to leave an easier way
A note to Red reads I ll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready for you
Strikingly similar to Christ s words to us In my Father s house there are many rooms I am going there to prepare a place for you
LRB John RRB In Christian theology our Hope is certain and our good future already begun because of Christ s death burial and resurrection pictures you ca nt miss in The Shawshank Redemption he story begins with the trial of a young banker Andy Dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover
After a quick conviction Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison with no hope of parole
He exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him
His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from Ellis Redding
Ellis commonly referred to as Red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison
Andy s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him
Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyleBy creating the film s firm foundation the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film s success
Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King s equally noteworthy novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
In this novella King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature
Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short resulting in one of the best book to film transitions everWhile maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella Darabont also proves that a film s score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience as dialogue does
He employs the cunning Thomas Newman son of the legendary Hollywood composer Alfred Newman
Darabont shows recognition for the film s needs by employing Newman who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer as if a part of the scripted dialogue
Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition
His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed as his score received an Oscar nomination in
While unique and independent Newman s score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the filmWith work from vast array of talented scene designers costume designers composers cinematographers and various other Hollywood artists the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with
The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film
While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red respectively the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles
Most noticeable of these the veteran film star James Whitmore who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen
Brooks a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead
Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art and a focused purpose in their motivations creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievableWith all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts like hope and freedom
These themes which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story
Though full of hardened criminals your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date
Like a great novel this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience
Darabont tells his story most masterfully illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think
He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption something we all seekThis film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich s and predictability
Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities
These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you
The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film
It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget
The one film I have loved since I was young being born a year before it came out means I missed the initial release I had cried through some amazing scenes and at the story line
Written and developed in such a way that this film I beg everyone just sit down and watch this on the edge of the sit film with a box of tissues and prepare for the film that had made some of the greatest actors in Hollywood
With the recent shock that this film never made the budget and lost about is shocking
The first time I watched this film I was on my own sat in the front room when I was It broke me I had to run upstairs to my mum and cry
Truly a great and breathtaking film

In exchange he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates including Red
Based on a story by Stephen King The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont
Mark Deming Rovi Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB is an accountant who accused of murdering his wife entered Shawshank prison in

Pretty soon his stoic manner gets the attention of narrator Redding LRB Morgan Freeman RRB
Redding is the local smuggler
He admires Andy s positive attitude

Wherein the prisoners of life accept their fate and stop dreaming to avoid being disappointed
Offcourse there s always one who is determined to break through
The Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope friendship and surviving within the walls of a heavily guarded prison
This movie is a shiny jewel

The Shawshank Redemption can be considered an old movie but with time I realize that there will not be a better movie than this
It s emotional with a strong impact and with a perfect actors gameNowdays the world movie store gives us a huge diversity from exciting action movies and frightening and intriguing thrillers or horrors to emotional dramas bun no one of them is capable to transmit such a comprehensive package of emotions concern intrigue sadness pity and elation especially
The action line is so complex that with no effort awakens admiration and astonishment
The message is very profound and it manages to touch the heart and the spiritual world of the every viewerThank you Frank Darabont and Stephen King for the best movie ever
the main effect used in the movie is that the inside story is kept preserved for most of the time in the movie and revealed suddenly at the last movement
this was a great journey
the story narration of the movie is perfectthe direction of the movie from starting to the last is very much appreciated this movie also teaches us that whatever be the way we have to struggle continuously in our life
and one day we will o purely get successas a whole it was a very good movie and this type of movie should be appreciated
may be it does not have a very true story but this movie proves that only script does not matters The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best allround movies of all time
The story is powerful in that it represents real issues in society not petty ones that a lot of movies nowadays base their stories off of that are usually unrealistic anyways
The characters are interesting and have strong character arcs and the highs and lows are extreme highs and lows there s not doubt you ll be moved by this story
And to top it all off the acting is well executed believable and entertaining
It raised the bar for movies for ever
If you have nt seen this movie yet I d say it is a must see movie in my books

Congragulations for the writer because it s a Great story
Maybe it s simple but very strong and attractive scenario
n the scenario the surprises make the film better
would like to thanks all the person who worked for this fantastic movie
The story takes you from the beginning and you are putting your self into the Tim RobbinsSimple and strong
I will watch again with my family
t show you there is no need only computer tricks for make good movies When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes how to struggle to be free
And do nt never forget hope is good something and good somethings never die this sentence which passes in the film I always believe it every part of mine
Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so If it is seized from people that people lose their aims in the life
And what the best properties of this film It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption Whenever I watch this film I learn that it puts in new things my life
It is so important for every watcher Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you RRB This is a brilliant movie with a great cast and realistic sets
This is a movie that everyone should see its story is beautiful and very well presented
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were brilliant for the parts they played it had a great ending and a good tense climate i will not mention the plot in this review as it is so brilliant and anyone reading this who has not yet viewed this movie must do so soon
The post production work added great sound effects and music soundtracks
It was filmed beautifully and the camera work was superb and great work from the cinematographer as the locations were very well set for the movie I am going to keep this short and sweet tot give you time to go out and buy the DVD and indulge yourself in a film masterpiece
This movie absolutely tugs at every emotional string during it s powerful story line and triumph
This a must see and also a classic
Regardless of your personal preference and movie demographic this movie will not disappoint
And of course Morgan Freeman in my opinion is and always will be one ofis the greatest actor LRB s RRB of all time
I remember watching this as a child and even being moved but not necessarily understanding the basis of it
Now being older and watching it multiple times it never looses it s edge
And hopefully generations from now can enjoy it as I have
And I also own the VHS LRB Remember those
lol RRB
And the Blu ray edition along with the DVD
Well enough rambling and I apologize I just truly love this movie
One of my all time favorites
Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship
The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively
And James Whitmore s portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving
The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film
As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair
If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it
As I bet you ll want to see this one more than once
As mentioned In summary Masterpiece is an apt word for this film
It is filled with Everything what the Viewers Needed
Dark And sensuality makes the film very realistic
All characters lived their roles and The best performance however comes from Morgan Freeman as Red suave yet very charismatic
Acting is nt just about your vocal range it s about depth which was what Freeman certainly had
In short
Awesome movie Give it a Look and u will never feel wasted
Masterpiece at its best
There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film
Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work
I still ca nt believe this was his first movie
he will find it hard to top this masterful film
Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman who has composed a simple but perfect score for this film
His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant as is the rest of his scoreGive it a Watch for sure
Do nt believe anyone who says that this film is overrated
In my view it is one of the most outstanding pieces of cinema in recent times
The reason that Shawshank is so good is that it is marvellously wellexecuted in several aspects
The most notable of these is the acting Morgan Freeman is in fine form as Red a longserving inmate who befriends new prisoner Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins
Robbins performance left me amazed as his portrayal of Andy was so rich and layered that even the most cynical viewer would struggle not to feel for him
The journey of the character his struggles and his victories great and small are so deeply satisfying that you can not tear your eyes away from it
The story also has great pacing courtesy of director Frank Darabont it never feels hurried nor does it drag
The development of the friendship between Andy and Red is done particularly well the way it changes and grows deeper as time passes LRB the film spans nearly years RRB and how you learn more about each character feels natural
Darabont also perfectly captures the atmosphere of life in Shawshank prison
The script is gold giving a fantastic narrative through Red and including some rather poignant sentiments that we can all connect with on some level mainly Andy s thoughts on hope and freedom
There is some discussion over whether The Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather is more deserving of the film spot
For me there s no contest yes The Godfather is a great piece of film in many ways but the fact is that it does nt satisfy you nearly as much as Shawshank on any level
This film feels like it matters and by the end LRB without trying to sound too corny RRB it leaves you with a sense of sheer joy and wonder that is rare in films nowadays
Wellmade outstandingly acted and deeply satisfying this incredible film strikes a chord with us all and deserves every bit of praise that it gets
The movie features friendship and the bond created between two strangers who have never met each other before
How they feel comfort in a place like Shawshank which I can say is a Hell in real life
Kudos to the directors and actors for such a lovely masterpiece and a must watch for all movie lovers
Even those jaded film fans will love The Shawshank Redemption because it sets a new standard for films in this genre
The movie will make you emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life even when that life is spent in a cage and will make viewers laugh cry and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can
It may not have won a single Oscar but it will win your heart and perhaps that is more important and you will realize it once you have watched this one
A strong recommendation
An epic movie about how strong the relations between humans can be when the freedom is taken and is replaced by the dedication hope and trust
When your universe has fallen you become undressed of the world s pervert feelings and your inside broken castle reborns
The main character of the movie gives us a lesson of how much the inside dreams must be followed by any means even if the sorrow is against us
Places like the prison gives the real image of the value inside the people
The optimisticfinal in the movie is a message to all of us that if we follow our ideals passing through the harshest conditions we will realise that everything is possible and we will become better peopleOne of my all time favorites
Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship
The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance

If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it
As I bet you ll want to see this one more than once
An exceptional drama with one of the best onscreen duos in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins
WriterDirector Frank Darabont made on of the mustsee movies for any film fanatic
Yes the film might be bit overrated but that does nt mean that it s not worthy of the praise it has been getting over the yearsThe story is gripping and timeless and is good for multiple viewing
Cinematography is beautiful and the execution of the time frame is stungThe film is not without its flaws but they are so minor that they are over shadowed by how the film carries itself
Whether you like the movie or not is always subjective but one thing is for sure The Shawshank Redemption will leave an impression on you
It has been a pretty long time since i have seen such a great movie great actors and great play of roles
Watching this movie made me realize a little evolution on movies spirit knowing that lately film companies are trying to put technology first
In general the movie managed to build a very strong emotional link between characters in the film and apparently that link is strong enough to make us feel for them and share feelings with the castI simply love everything about this movie beginning from Andy s first day in prison to his last day lockedI was impressed with the details they were perfectly handled LRB per say RRB like the time when Andy tried to hit the pipes on the same time with the storm so the guards would not hear him trying to escape
Those little things matter a lot
I gave it a and enjoyed watching it
Simply beautiful
First things first ill admit it
I went in to shawshank with low expectationsI was expecting a two hour bore fest a type of godfathercitizen Kane film which as a film fan you MUST watch and MUST love and if you do nt you just do nt get it
But I did nt get that
Not at allWithin the first half hour this film got more emotion out of me than most others get throughout their whole running time all simply from a LRB ahem RRB slightly over weight man weeping calling out for his mother all while the other prisoners are teasing him in their cellsThe first act ofthe film constantly has this dark feel to it inserting it deep in yourmind that prison is not a nice place
Red brilliantly played by Morganfreeman describes andys daily attempted rapes by the sisters
We are shown a recently set free prisoner killing himself
This first act is hard to watch
Not as in boring or gory
In fact I found some of the scenes in this part harder to watch than I found saw
But get through the first act it sets you up for a second act
A second act of hope
A second act of friendship
A second act of humour
And for the leads a second act if redemption
The two slowly through general decency start to become better people then they were on the outside LRB albeit one getting institutionalised LRB watch the film or get a dictionary RRB RRB
To say best film is a bold statement as a film fan on the Internet in a world that has gems such as the godfather apocalypse now citizen Kane goodfellas Casablanca the list goes on and on
But what this film does more so than the others is make you feel something deep down inside of you
A feeling that will stay with you days after you watch it
I saw this film when I was fourteen and at the time it was the most flawlessly impressive piece of storytelling I had ever seen
If I were forced to make a top list this movie would certainly be right up there
Robbins and Freeman are both incredible and as good as they are in other films I would still say it remains their finest work
The scenery and costumes the prison which if I remember right was an actual prison back around the same time the film took place
It is all so rich with texture and detail that it draws you in
The story is great Stephen King has written some amazing stories and this is a testament that he is not just a horror novel expert
The actors all take it to the next level and make it a pretty much perfect film
It is pretentious to say a film or any piece of art is perfect however I honestly ca nt say there is anything I dislike about the film
No scene seems long and unnecessary every actor is perfectly cast and feels very authentic
It really is the real deal
Like American History X and some other films it is a movie that everyone with a moderately high IQ and a love of cinema should see one dayA good fast paced movie
Not your typical prison movie
Tim Robbins has a cool demeanor and Morgan Freeman does a great job in his supporting role as well as narrating the film
Kudos also to the warden and his sadistic enforcer
This movie has a lot more character development and depth than your typical prison movie
It can be slightly depressing at times but what drama is nt
I m not even the drama type and even I liked this movie
This movie does a great job of evoking feelings of fear anger excitement sadness hope and inspiration
This film is nt for the faint of heart
The music score contributes greatly to the film
A must see for drama lovers
I will never forget how I was introduced to this film
My very abstract thinking gypsy of a cousin was visiting our home and as we began talking about films made mention of this one
She followed with the traditional line of What You have not seen that movie
Oh my God it s the GREATEST
With reluctance LRB really to be honest we just did not want to be rude RRB
we all agreed to watch
What transpired over the next hours was the greatest movie I have ever seen
This movie covers every spectrum of the human existence possible
Death life heartache love friendship betrayal injustice and of course justice just to name a few
The entire movie is a roller coaster of the human condition and the end will leave you bathing in tears and triumph
I have seen so many movies both old and new in my life but this one is just above them all
The last minutes alone are worth the price of admission A must watch for everyone
Why do I want to write the th comment on The Shawshank Redemption
I am not sure almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said
But like so many other people who wrote comments I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption
The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird
Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched themI did nt intend to see this movie at all I do not like prison movies and I do nt normally watch them
I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better
At the time I thought that was very strange
One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already
I remembered what she said so I watched it
I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showingNo action no special effects just men in prison uniforms talking to each otherThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen
I do not judge it by it s technical merits I do nt really care about that
I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made
They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best
The best movies are ones that touch the soul
It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul
great movie
i enjoyed when they broke princess leia out of her cell and used the hole behind the poster to slide down the tunnel and away from that huge boulder that was chasing them
king of the north
this is a prison i would grow a tree at with seeds from a viper
where did larry get those glasses with x ray vision
my vote is for the girl who was born a boy
i m not saying that sugar is in my blood but i can lift a car over my head have you seen my clean and hairless feet my ears look like a rusty clam after someone yells bingo is all you ever need to is not about any particular trend of shoes perry knocked over table
The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time
I love the story and the cast and settings of the movie
I have seen the movie many times and each time I enjoy it more and more
I love Stephen King s original story and the way the movie script sticks closely to this
All of the characters shine especially Andy and Red
The message of hope in the story has kept me strong over the yearsI have a big question
In the facts list the music which Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB plays over the PA system with the door to the warden s office locked it says the music is Duettino Sull Aria or Sull aria the Soave Zeffaretto from the Marriage of Figaro by Mozart
This is not true
The ORIGINAL music Andy plays is THE FLOWER DUET from the opera LAKME by Debiles
MY QUESTION IS IF this is the original music why and when was there a change in this music
The Flower Duet is indeed the most inspiring and beautiful music ever composed and fits very well with the stunning remarks in Morgan Freeman s Thoughtmonologue
MY QUESTION IS what music is written in the book if it is or was it the choice of the director
or writer
Does anyone have the actual book I emailed Rich Caparella of the classic station KUSC since he planned to play THE FLOWER DUET on his program and he replied that he found it quite interesting and assumed the problem was concerning rights and contracts to play the music
But why the coverup I will not rest till I find out the truth about this because it kind of ruins the whole movie if that music has been changed
The duet by Mozart is not inspiring AT ALL really compared to The Flower Duet likely the most beautiful music ever composed
Simon Wilby simonwilbycom when i saw top movie ranking i found this one but my point of view is this this movie is good but also made a hope for jail broken theme
this is also not a good over all good example for best hope RRB
OVERALL SCORE A The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well
More than any film in memory it proved there is life after box office
Besting Forrest and Fiction it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of
It currently sits at in the IMDb s Top Films occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time redemption indeed
If you have nt seen it yet what the hell are you waiting for
As Andy says It comes down a simple choice really
Either get busy living or get busy dying
I Do nt know how many times i have watched this movie and i know i will definitely watch it again but this movie always inspire me whenever i lost my hope and got imprisoned by fear of failure and wrongdoings it helps to conquer this premisei often thrown in to oblivion whenever i have no idea about what to do the one quote made me busy with my life is Get busy living or Get busy dying
In fact quotes from the movie stick to my desktop which could not be removed even by myselfFurthermore the climaxQuestion arose when I saw a movie with that high rating in IMDb
After finally found this movie and saw it by myself I can say that the rating shows everything this is one of a top movie you should watch before you die
No matter that Shawshank was defeated in all its nominations of Academy Award number of award is not always a correct guideline to tell you whether a movie is good or not
The theme is just simple if we compare with s movies mainly talks about friendship and hope
In this almostpercentmaleactors film there is no special sound effect sciencefiction complicated visual effect super makeup on actorsactresses just the story and dialogs
But the theme is so unique can say this is a signature film about prison and the message it brings will stay forever after you finished watching so that you ll never forget
That s why I gave a I was really surprisedshocked about this movie s ending and even tried to watch it again about timesStill rethink to watch this movie
Trust me you ll not disappointed
And one more thing do nt compare it to Forrest Gump
Both of these movies have distinct special messages themselves both are good both are unique
And after that you ll be able to talk to everyone about the message Shawshank brings
of the movie made me shocked as well as concluded the bottom line Hope is a Good Thing which i still follow and forever
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen
When I was younger I would always see this movie playing on various channels and always wondered why
What made this movie so special
Well the answer is pretty much everything in this movie is special from the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose characters are really fleshed out in subtle ways to the overall themes that have made the movie so watchable ever since it was first released
There is a reason this movie is still being played on channels to this day
If you have not seen this movie than go watch it immediately
You wont regret it
A day full of thoughts after you watch this and the remarkable feeling how you make a movie like this
Time is totally worth it
Do nt expect it as a random prison story
Plain and simpleNo action and effects
The truth to ultimate reality
No goofs as there s an explanation to every scene
I think every actor in the movie gave their best performances
Just awesome
Sad feeling all around but ending is awesomeCharacter Andy comes out to be cooler than you think he is and shows everyone this is nt it and you might think and which i thought to be so straight forward was his lucky cell location which can certainly be overlooked because after this is what he deserved as he was innocent
Going to prison is never easy and almost an unimaginable experience for most people
It s even worse if you are sentenced for fifty years despite being innocent
Shawshank Redemption is an incredible movie
Not only because of its fantastic narration and storytelling technique
Not only because of the emotional yet inspirational performances put on by each and every actoractress
Not even the spectacular filming and perfect settings
No what makes Shawshank Redemption a truly excellent film is the complete story and the very relatable tale that is the life of Andy DufresneThis movie focuses on the lives of minor characters life in and out of prison and how the system has changed so many men and women drastically
And it s these individual stories that make Andy s even more special
He was able to stay strong to manage without friends or support in the worst times
He was a man no one would have looked at twice
No one special
Just another person like you and me
Yet his story is one that we can all imagine ourselves in
Where bad circumstances meet inexplicable motives and it s being capable of imagining ourselves in Andy s shoes that makes Shawshank Redemption such a beautiful movieThis movie stands for a lot of things
Love respect peace and friendship among other things
More so than the rest Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope
Having faith in the future secretly knowing good will overcome badNo one knows what our future holds
But if we could all live like Andy optimistic and ever so kind in the most dire of situations holding up true justice this world would be a better place
An excellent Movie One of the best I ve ever watched about two men who seek redemption from the institutionalization of the prison
They seek freedom yet like the place
It is about friendship happiness tears
The Movie is about a banker on how he is sent to prison for his wife s murder and makes friends there He turns out to be very popular among the inmates
The film brilliantly narrates the life of prisoners who spend their lives decently
As it turns out that he is innocent He finally Plans and breaks out of the prisonThe movie is beautifully written directed and the cherry on the top is Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins
The dialogue delivery
the expression
the acting holds you during the entire movie A must watch movie The Shawshank Redemption The Shawshank redemption is a film that takes place in the s
Andy Dufresne which is played by Tim Robins is a known banker located in Maine
He was sent to prison with two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover
Andy Dufrense maintains his innocence throughout the film
Andy serves as the main character for the film
Ellis Redding which is played by Morgan Freeman and goes by the nickname red is known as the go to guy
When Andy arrives to the prison Red places a bet with the other inmates that Andy would be the one to break down first out of all the inmates that arrived with Andy on the bus
Andy gains knowledge of Red s capability to obtain contraband and approaches with an order
From then on Andy and Red become inseparable for the duration of the film
There are many themes employed in the film but I believe the most significant theme is hope
Andy continues to maintain his innocence even after his conviction and hopes he will one day be released
Red and Andy talk about future plans that they hope will one day come true once they are released from prison
Andy begins working in the laundry room and is seen as fresh meat to a group known as the sisters
The sisters are a known group of inmates that pick out weak inmates to abuse and rape
The sisters begin to rape and beat Andy shortly after they encounter the opportunity
The abuse and rape continues on for several years until Andy gets picked to repair the prisons roof
This gave Andy a sigh of hope that there is an escape path
He was able to escape the abuse that he endured from the sisters so he believed he would be able to escape prison all together
The lighting in the film establishes great lighting effects
The director utilizes lowkey lighting for the scenes in the prison
The lowkey lighting creates a gloomy dreadful feel to the scenes
This lighting was chosen by the director to give the prison scenes an intense dramatic feel
Highkey lighting was utilized for the outdoor scenes which employed a feeling of happiness and hope
This intrigued Andy to want to escape prison and helped him make a final decision which was to escape prison once his tunnel was finished
Hope kept Andy going and kept him striving to survive
Even when he endured the most severe hardships he never lost hope to one day escape his pain
Overall the film was a magnificent production
The movie received several Academy awards including American Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases and Japan Academy Prize for Outstanding Foreign Language Film
The film did not receive much profit while in theaters but has received promising reviews from critics
I think this movie is very meaningful
I like it very much
You must think so too
You must all have a lot to say
But according to what we have appointed Im the Chair so please let me show you my opinion first
The story begins with the trial of a young banker Andy Dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover
After a quick conviction Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison with no hope of parole
He exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him
His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from Ellis Redding
Ellis commonly referred to as Red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison
Andy s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him
Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle
As far as Im concerned this movie shows us three things freedom friendship and hope
If we take a movie as a novel then Shawshank Redemption is a great novel without doubt
It reflects the real social life and creates several typical characters with Classic Quotes and a few kinds of modifications
This movie organizes the main scenario of the story in a simple way and at the same time using some petty lines
It expresses the subject in a very artistic way
There were three words the first is freedom
However what impressed me is nearly everyone in the prison got accustomed to the prison life
Whats more an old man even suicide after he was set free
I have a very deep feeling of friendship
The second word accrued to me is friendship
Friendship is a necessary in our life
In this movie the friendship between Andy and Red moved me
It gave me an idea getting a real friendship is more important than money and power
Friendship is really important and in my opinion it is very hard to get a real friendship
When we do nt have a real friend we will feel very lonely
I may have this feeling during these days
That is really incredibly hard
Also there are some sentences in the movie that really impressed me
The sentence I like most is hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies
Because I think it encourages people appreciate the beauty of life to keep their hope in heart forever
It was as if some beautiful birds had flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away and for the briefest of moments every last man in Shawshank felt free
From this sentence I start to know that in fact something can not be noticed at all
That is like the freedom of our heart
We need it just like you have never forgotten it
Another one is Fear can hold you prisoner
Hope can set you free
A strong man can save himself
A great man can save another
I like this sentence because it teaches me to let me full of courage and hopes
It urges me to have the determination to succeed
In the end I want to use a sentence to summarize this movie Fear can hold you prisoner
Hope can set you free
This is my first review on IMDb and about the number one movie on the TOP because it deserves his title and there are people that think that it did nt
The movie tells about a man that is made prisoner because of a crime he claim he did nt committed and spend his days dreaming about freedom and justice
The movies shows the bad things that happened to him on prison and how hope makes him believe that he still can have his freedom even when things are pretty bad to himAnd thats why this movie makes people fell better and makes we have hope on ours own lives because even when the things are really bad and you LRB thinks RRB you have lost hope there still hope never give up of your dreams and always believe that justice can be made
Like said by Pittacus Lore in I Am Number Four When you have lost hope you have lost everything
And when you think all is lost when all is dire and bleak there is always hope
and that is the reason because this movie is on IMDb TOP when we finish watching this movie your state of mind is so good that we had the power to change our lives and believes that everything is possible
That s the difference to the other movies it is not only entertainment with a great movie but also can be a change of perspective of life
The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about time patience and loyalty not sexy qualities perhaps but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despairThe story is narrated by Red Redding LRB Morgan Freeman RRB who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur
He can get you whatever you need cigarettes candy even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use
One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison and who will not
Red bets on a tall lanky guy named Andy Dufresne LRB Tim Robbins RRB who looks like a babe in the woodsBut Andy does not cry and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered
Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him
Andy was a banker on the outside and he s in for murder
He s apparently innocent and there are all sorts of details involving his case but after a while they take on a kind of unreality all that counts inside prison is its own society who is strong who is not and the measured passage of timeRed is also a lifer
From time to time measuring the decades he goes up in front of the parole board and they measure the length of his term LRB years years RRB and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated
Oh most surely yes he replies but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized that like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled he can no longer really envision life on the outsideRed s narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years
Andy will not kiss butt
He will not back down
But he is not violent just formidably sure of himself
For the warden LRB Bob Gunton RRB he is both a challenge and a resource Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation and before long he s been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden s office where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden s illgotten gains
His fame spreads and eventually he s doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison systemThere are key moments in the film as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job
Or when he befriends the old prison librarian LRB James Whitmore RRB
Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement
What quietly amazes everyone in the prison and us too is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully seeThe partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds
This is not a prison drama in any conventional sense of the word
It is not about violence riots or melodrama
The word redemption is in the title for a reason
The movie is based on a story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King which is quite unlike most of King s work
The horror here is not of the supernatural kind but of the sort that flows from the realization than years of a man s life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routineThe director Frank Darabont paints the prison in drab grays and shadows so that when key events do occur they seem to have a life of their ownAndy as played by Robbins keeps his thoughts to himself
Red as Freeman plays him is therefore a crucial element in the story His close observation of this man down through the years provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him
And all the time there is something else happening hidden and secret which is revealed only at the end
The Shawshank Redemption is not a depressing story although I may have made it sound that way
There is a lot of life and humor in it and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red
There is even excitement and suspense although not when we expect it
But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth despite everything
If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages maybe that is part of the idea too to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time before the glory of the final redemption
A man is sent to prison and has to learn to adapt to prison life there he meets a wise old gentleman who he befriends and there friendship grows immensely
along the way he meets different prison characters all of which are very likable adapted from a short short by Steven King this is a powerful movie showing prison life in the early th century
Tim Robbins was wonderful in this and should have won an award Morgan freeman is captivating in his role as Red Our main character Andy Dufrene plans a prison break and needs the help of several of the inmates
I wont say what happens after his attempted prison break but this is a touching movie with a lot of character development and not much on the action but it really does nt need to have a lot of action lot s of humor abound a movie about growing up in person and the people that you might and the life struggles of being in prison excellent movie
but not the greatest of all time I can think of at least better
One of my all time favourite movies
The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence
During his time at the prison he befriends a fellow inmate Ellis Boyd Red Redding and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation
Definitely worth the watch if you have nt seen it
You are missing out
It is well written scripted and well acted by Freeman and Robbins
This classic will be one that can be watched over and over
Frank Darabont made this the classic it is
I loved the Screenplay of this movie
How he narrate the story from start to end
I watched this movie in my mother tang TAMIL
That was awesome That helped lot to understand each and every line of the story
Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening
Of course some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity but most places of worship are open only certain days or times
Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever
He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifullyThe bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie
It takes you in from the opening scene and does nt let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous closelike Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable
In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for solong
Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach
